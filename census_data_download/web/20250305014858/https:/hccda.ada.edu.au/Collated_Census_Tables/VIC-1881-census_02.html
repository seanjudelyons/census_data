		<h1 class="chapter-title">CENSUS OF VICTORIA, 1881. GENERAL REPORT.</h1>
		<p><span class="emphasis">To the Honorable the Chief Secretary.</span></p>
		<p>Office of the Government Statist,</p>
		<p>Melbourne, 19th February 1883.</p>
		<p>SIR,</p>
		<p>The Census returns having now been compiled, and the greater portion of them published, I do myself the honor to submit the following Report thereon :—</p>
		
			<h1 class="section-title">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>In consequence of the pressure of more urgent business, some delay has taken place in the issue of this Report ; but this has not been without its advantages. Thereby time has been given to the other colonies of the group to complete the compilation of their returns, and thus I am enabled to make comparisons between the results disclosed by the Victorian Census and those brought to light by the Census returns of each of the other Australasian colonies.
						<span class="annotation"> [Preliminary remarks.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>Meanwhile the public has been kept fully informed respecting the results of the Census of this colony. Not only were summaries of each of the Parts published in the<span class="emphasis">Government Gazette</span>as soon as they could be got ready, and afterwards largely distributed, but several of the completed Parts have been laid before Parliament, and a short digest of the returns under each of the principal heads of inquiry, except the "Occupations" (the compilation of which had not then been finished), was embodied in the last issue of the<span class="emphasis">Victorian Year-Book</span>.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>Unusual interest is attached to the Census of 1881, as it was an undertaking in which almost every portion of Her Majesty's dominions took part. As soon as the day for taking the Census of the United Kingdom was fixed, a circular was sent from
						<span class="annotation"> [Simultaneous Census of British dominions.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_2"></div>
			<p>the Colonial Office to each of the colonies of the Empire, recommending that its Census should also be taken on the same day. This course was agreed to by every one of the Australasian colonies, and it thus happens that for the first time<div class="footnote">
					<p>On the occasion of the previous Census of the United Kingdom (2nd April, 1871), the Censuses of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia were also taken. Queensland did not take her Census until the 1st September 1871, or five months later, whilst Western Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand had already taken their Censuses, the first on the 31st March 1870, the second on the 7th February 1870, and the third on the 27th February 1871.</p>
				</div>the populations of all the colonies of this group and of Great Britain and Ireland have been enumerated simultaneously.</p>
		
		
			<h1 class="section-title">TAKING OF THE CENSUS.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>The Census of Victoria was taken under a Statute (44 Vict. No. 667) specially passed for the purpose of giving legality to the undertaking. This Statute fixed the day on which the enumeration was to be made, gave the Governor in Council power to appoint the requisite officers, roughly defined the process to be pursued, and made the Government Statist the officer responsible for carrying out the work.
						<span class="annotation"> [Census Act.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
				<p>The householder's schedule attached to the Census Act contained the usual inquiries respecting the name, sex, relation to the head of the family, conjugal condition, age, occupation, birthplace, religion, and education of each member of every household ; also whether any of such members were unable to follow their usual occupations in consequence of illness or accident, or were deaf and dumb, blind, lunatic, imbecile, epileptic, or leprous ; what were the materials of the house and what number of rooms it contained, and what number of each description of live stock was kept. Any person refusing to fill up the householder's schedule, or to supply particulars for entry therein, rendered himself liable to a penalty not exceeding Twenty pounds, except in the case of the inquiry as to religion, which persons might, if they pleased, decline to answer, the word "object" being in such cases entered in the "religion" column. Any officer, enumerator, sub-enumerator, or clerk divulging any of the contents of a householder's schedule rendered himself liable to a penalty of Twenty pounds.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>Appended to the Census Act there was a second schedule, called the Educational Schedule. This was specially devised for the purpose of ascertaining what number of children in the colony were receiving education and in what instances this was being imparted at a State or at a private school (the name and address or number of the school being in each case given), or by a tutor, governess, relative, or other
						<span class="annotation"> [Educational census.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_3"></div>
			<p>person. The information in this schedule was obtained for the purpose of assisting the Education Department in its endeavors to compel every child in the community to comply with the provisions of the law, which requires it to be instructed up to a certain standard. It was therefore, for obvious reasons, not considered confidential, as was the case in respect to all the other information obtained at the Census. Persons refusing the information for this schedule were liable to a penalty not exceeding Ten pounds.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
				<p>The Census Act also gave the Governor in Council power to make regulations for the collection of agricultural, educational, and industrial statistics, and accordingly regulations were framed by the Government Statist, and duly submitted and gazetted, to which the following schedules were appended :—(1.) The agricultural schedule, containing provision for obtaining returns of the extent and tenure of land in occupation, the area under and produce of each description of crop, the number and value of the agricultural implements used and the value of improvements made. (2.) The school schedule, containing provision for returning the name and address of every school, the religious denomination, if any, with which it was connected, the number of teachers attached to it, the number, ages, and sexes of the scholars who attended on the day following the Census day, and the average number of those who attended during the previous week. (3.) The manufactory and quarry schedule, containing provision for ascertaining particulars respecting the number of persons and nature and amount of power employed in every establishment in which goods of the total value of £100 or upwards were manufactured annually, all works at which steam, gas, or water power were employed, and all stone quarries ; also the approximate value in all such establishments of the materials used, of the articles produced, and of the machinery and plant, lands, and buildings ; together with some other particulars respecting the goods produced in several descriptions of establishments specially named. (4.) The mining machinery schedule, containing provisions for obtaining particulars, including the value, respecting the steam engines employed in mining, the stamp-heads used, and the puddling machines in operation. Any one refusing to supply the information for these returns rendered himself liable to a penalty not exceeding Five pounds, and any one revealing their contents to a penalty not exceeding Twenty pounds.
						<span class="annotation"> [Agricultural, school, industrial, and mining census.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
				<p>The method of taking the Census was similar to that adopted on previous occasions. In the first place the colony was mapped out by the Government Statist into districts, each of which was placed under the charge of an officer called an enumerator, who in turn divided his district into sub-districts, each to be assigned to an officer called a sub-enumerator, charged with the duty of distributing and collecting
						<span class="annotation"> [Formation of Census districts.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_4"></div>
			<p>the Census papers, but acting in this respect, as in all others, under the direction of the enumerator.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
				<p>On former occasions the enumerators' districts were based upon the electoral districts, but the boundaries of these having been changed since the Census of 1871, under<span class="emphasis">The Electoral Act Amendment Act</span>1876 (40 Vict. No. 548), it became necessary to entirely redivide the colony for Census purposes. In doing this I determined to make the Census districts fit in as far as possible with the counties, which, being permanent divisions, appeared to be better suited to form the basis of such districts than the electoral districts, the boundaries of which are liable to be changed from time to time.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
				<p>In forming the enumerators' districts, the chief objects kept in view were—first, that each district should be of such an extent, having regard to its area and the amount of work to be done, as to be readily under the control of the enumerator ; and secondly, that the boundaries should be well defined and easily discoverable upon the ground. In thickly peopled parts of the colony, a county was necessarily divided : thus, Bourke was partitioned into 23 districts, and Grant and Talbot each into 6 districts. In more scattered parts, as in the case of the counties of Evelyn and Anglesey, one county was taken as a district ; and in very thinly peopled localities, such as Gippsland and the Wimmera, a district was made to consist of several entire counties. The boundaries of counties were followed wherever possible, and when it became necessary to subdivide a county this was done in almost every instance at the boundary of a shire or riding.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
				<p>The districts into which the colony was divided for Census purposes numbered 76 ; the shipping in places under the jurisdiction of the Melbourne Harbor Trust and that in other ports and places, together with some of the lighthouses, formed two others, so that the total number of Census districts was 78.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
				<p>For some districts the applications for the office of enumerator were very numerous ; for others there were not many applications ; and for a few none whatever were received. In the last-named cases the municipal authorities were requested to name a competent person to fill the office. The merits of the various applicants were very carefully considered by the Government, and the appointments given to those who appeared most suitable. As a rule the selection turned out to be a judicious one, most of the enumerators having proved themselves eminently fitted for the service. There were a few exceptions, which there probably would have been under whatever system the enumerators might have been chosen.
						<span class="annotation"> [Appointment of enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
				<p>The Harbor Master of the port of Melbourne was made enumerator for the shipping in all places under the jurisdiction of the Melbourne Harbor Trust, and the</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_5"></div>

				<p>Each enumerator, on being appointed, was supplied with specific instructions as to the nature of his duties, also with two maps of his district, on which were delineated not only its boundaries, but any county, electoral, or municipal boundaries which in any direction crossed it. He was told to divide his district into sub-districts, each of a suitable size to be assigned to a sub-enumerator, to mark such subdivisions clearly upon those maps, to make an estimate of the number of houses in each sub-district, and state the number of days he proposed to allow the sub-enumerator for completing it, which particulars he was to enter upon a form supplied him for the purpose, entitled "Enumerator's Schedule A." He was further instructed that, when this was done, one map and one copy of Schedule A were to be returned to this office, so that a judgment might be formed of the propriety of his arrangements, the other map and a second copy of Schedule A being retained for his own guidance.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
				<p>In dividing his district the enumerator was instructed that he should, if possible, make his sub-districts of such a size as to admit of their being enumerated in three days—viz, one day for depositing and two days for collecting the schedules—to effect which he should, in towns, where the houses lie close together, allow a sub-district to contain from 150 to 200 inhabited houses ; in suburban districts, villages, and goldfields, where the dwellings are not so near to one another as in a closely built town, he should allow from 100 to 150 such houses ; in the more settled agricultural districts, where not more than half-a-mile intervenes between a dwelling and the next nearest, he should allow from 50 to 100, and in more scattered agricultural districts, where intervals of two miles or upwards sometimes occur between two dwellings, he should allow less than 50. In laying out pastoral and other widely scattered districts, he was enjoined to use his own judgment, both as regards the number of habitations in a sub-district and the time to be allowed for their enumeration.</p>

				<p>As the maps and schedules showing the plan of subdivision were received from the enumerators, they were carefully examined by the Government Statist and his subordinates. Only a few of the schemes could be approved of in the first instance, and the majority had to be returned for amendment. The tendency in most cases was to make the sub-districts too large, which would have caused the collection to extend over a longer period than was desirable. On this subject a large amount of correspondence took place between the department and the enumerators, and to some of the latter it was found necessary to return their map and schedule of subdivision two and even three times. As a matter of fact only a small proportion even of the</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_6"></div>
			<p>town districts were eventually enumerated in three days, and in country districts the time occupied was generally much longer. Indeed, where so much information, embodied in so many schedules as were used on this occasion, is sought to be obtained, it is questionable whether it is practicable to adhere rigidly to the three days' rule in a country like Victoria.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
				<p>As soon as any enumerator's plan of subdivision was approved, he was told to appoint his sub-enumerators, and to submit a list of them on "Enumerator's Schedule B" for the approval of the Governor in Council. In making the appointments he was instructed to inform each sub-enumerator of the number of days it was proposed to allow him for the enumeration of his sub-district, and at the same time to tell him he could only obtain payment for that number unless some unforeseen circumstance should occur which might justify an additional allowance.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
				<p>The sub-enumerators, on their appointment, were supplied with all the requisite forms, and with printed instructions, in which their course of procedure was clearly laid down. In these instructions it was pointed out that the present Census embraced inquiries not only respecting the population and live stock to be embodied in the householder's schedule, but respecting educational, agricultural, and industrial matters to be embodied in schedules specially devoted to those subjects, and that, whilst giving due attention to all the heads of inquiry, they were to bear in mind that the most important were those to be recorded in the householder's schedule, and to secure these correctly should be their first consideration.</p>

				<p>Wherever any number of Chinese were congregated, persons versed in the Chinese language were engaged as sub-enumerators, for the purpose of securing correct particulars respecting the members of this race. In a few of the town districts the services of European interpreters were obtained, but in most instances the work was performed by English-speaking Chinamen. When these were not able to write English, which was generally the case, they merely accompanied the European sub-enumerator and interpreted to him. They were, however, paid and treated in all other respects as sub-enumerators.

				<p>To secure an accurate enumeration of the Aboriginal population, the co-operation of the Central Board for the Protection of the Aborigines was invited.

As in certain localities supposed to be infested with thieves and vagrants, it was judged that this night service might not be unattended with danger, the co-operation of the Chief Commissioner of Police was requested, and by his direction the force under his control afforded efficient protection to the Census officers wherever this was deemed necessary.</p>

				<p>In towns, rushes at the goldfields, and other densely peopled localities, the sub-enumerators acted on foot, and in more scattered districts on horseback. The total number of the former employed was 684, and of the latter 1,185. The shortest time for which any sub-enumerator received payment was 1 day, and the longest 28 days, and the average time to each sub-enumerator was 6.286 days.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">24.</h3>
				<p>The payments of the enumerators were fixed by the Government according to the size and presumed population of the different districts, the original amounts varying from £12 to £35. After the Census was over, however, many of the enumerators applied for an extra allowance in virtue of the amount of work, and especially of traveling, they had had to perform, and the difficulties they had had to encounter. This was generally conceded, the result being that the highest amount paid to any enumerator was £65, and the average to each one was about £28. The enumerators for the shipping performed their duties without remuneration.
						<span class="annotation"> [Payments to enumerators and sub-enumerators.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">25.</h3>
				<p>The rate of payment sanctioned to sub-enumerators was Ten shillings per diem to those acting on foot and £1 per diem to those who were mounted. The average amount earned by each of the former was £2 6s. 9d., and by each of the latter £7 4s. 5d.</p>

				<p>The forms for taking the Census were distributed to the enumerators and sub-enumerators throughout the colony in accordance with estimates of the population, houses, &amp;c., in each district, carefully made beforehand in the office of the Government Statist, but it will be readily understood that it was necessary to have many more forms printed than were actually filled. To avoid risk of falling short, in consequence of possible miscalculations, or of forms being lost or damaged, each of the sub-enumerators had to be furnished with a larger number than it was expected he would require for use ; then each enumerator was obliged to keep a stock in hand to enable him to meet the demands of any sub-enumerator who, notwithstanding the precautions taken, might actually, or might imagine himself likely to fall short ; and it was also necessary to keep a large reserve at the central office to satisfy applications from any

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">27.</h3>
				<p>The fact that a very much larger number of forms were printed than were used might, at first sight, lead to the conclusion that a waste occurred which might have been avoided by more careful calculation on the part of the Government Statist ; but this is not the case. The forms originally sent to the enumerators, in the majority of instances, turned out to be about the number which would allow only a fair margin over and above what were actually wanted for use ; but constant requisitions were sent in by many of the enumerators for further supplies, and these, in view of the urgency of the occasion, and the supposed better information the enumerators living in the locality were in a position to obtain, the Government Statist felt himself powerless to refuse. It, however, generally turned out that the documents supplied upon these requisitions were not required, and when the unused forms were returned to the head office, after the Census had been taken, it was found that from most, but not all the districts, about the same number came back as had been specially asked for in the manner stated.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">28.</h3>
				<p>To give a better idea than is conveyed by the figures in the table of the vast quantity of stationery used, it may be mentioned that the forms received by the Government Statist, almost all of which were sent out to the enumerators, amounted in weight to no less than six tons seven hundred weight ; this being entirely independent of the large number of additional forms employed for compiling the Census, which probably weighed fully another ton.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">29.</h3>
				<p>In order to prepare the public mind for the event of the Census, printed notices, ten thousand in number, issued under the signature of the Chief Secretary, were posted by the police at all police stations, railway stations, post offices, and other prominent places throughout the colony, and were thrice inserted as an advertisement in the<span class="emphasis">Government Gazette</span>and all the newspapers. The same notice was translated
						<span class="annotation"> [Notice given of Census.] </span>

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_9"></div>
			<p>into the Chinese language by Mr. C. P. Hodges, the well-known Chinese interpreter, and by means of a transfer prepared by him twelve hundred copies were lithographed, a thousand of which were posted in the Chinese quarters of the towns and goldfields, and the remainder distributed by hand amongst the leading persons belonging to the Chinese race.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">30.</h3>
				<p>Some displacement of population was apprehended in consequence of the Railway Department having, about the time the Census was taken, decided to despatch several excursion trains at cheap fares to enable country residents to view the Melbourne International Exhibition. As soon as the intention to do this was known, the Government Statist suggested to the Government that the starting of these trains should be postponed until a few days after the day of the Census. The Chief Secretary (Mr. Berry) approved of this recommendation, and so informed the Railway authorities, but it seems matters had gone so far that the latter found they could not put off the trains without committing such a breach of faith with the public as they were unwilling to accept the responsibility of, and consequently the trains were duly started. The effect of this was that two or three thousand residents, chiefly of the north-eastern portion of the colony, were away from their homes on the Census night, whereby the population of that portion was by so much diminished, and the population of the other parts, especially the metropolis, by so much increased. But this would not at all effect the accuracy of the enumeration of the population of the colony taken as a whole.
						<span class="annotation"> [Displacement of persons by excursion trains.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">31.</h3>
				<p>Fears were entertained that the returns of the population would be to a certain extent in excess of what they would be under ordinary circumstances, in consequence of the presence of the strangers who had come to Victoria for the purpose of visiting the Melbourne International Exhibition. There is, however, reason to believe that the numbers were not much affected by these. When the Census was taken the Exhibition had been open for a period of six months, and many visitors had left, which is proved by the fact that, according to the returns of the Immigration Department, the departures by sea recorded in the first quarter of 1881, which was that immediately preceding the Census day, nearly equalled the arrivals recorded during the same period. There is also no doubt that a large number went to the adjacent colonies overland, as this is known to be always the case when the departures thither by sea are numerous. Amongst those who left the colony about this period, it is probable there were many Victorians who had to put off their engagements, whether connected with business or pleasure, until the time for closing the Exhibition was drawing nigh ; it may be expected that these almost, if not entirely, counterbalanced the strangers who still remained in Melbourne.

				<p>At the suggestion of the Government Statist the Government gave directions that on the Sunday of the Census all telegraph offices should be kept open until the hour of 11 a.m., to permit of messages on the subject of the Census being transmitted to or from the Government Statist, who with a portion of his staff attended at his office on that day, and dealt with numerous communications which came from various parts of the colony.
						<span class="annotation"> [Telegrams delivered on Census Sunday.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">33.</h3>
				<p>On the day preceding that of the Census, and on alternate days in the week following it, advertisements were inserted in the journals throughout the colony requesting that any cases of neglect on the part of the Census collectors should be reported without delay to the Government Statist. This had the effect of eliciting a number of complaints of omission, which were immediately referred to the enumerators for investigation. Many of these complaints were found to be premature, and others groundless ; some, however, were really cases of neglect, and these were immediately rectified. Instead of reporting to the department, in compliance with the advertisement, some persons wrote to the newspapers stating that they or others they knew of had been missed, and imputing great negligence to the collectors. A large portion of the complaints made in this manner were so indefinite that no action could be taken in respect to them, even the editors of the newspapers in which they appeared being unable to give any clue to the writers or the localities they referred to. Whenever the information supplied was sufficiently explicit, the matter was inquired into, and in the majority of instances found to be without foundation. As, however, it was feared that the public might attach more importance to these complaints than they really merited, it was thought advisable to offer a small reward to any who could substantiate cases of omission. Ten shillings was the amount fixed upon, and accordingly an advertisement was inserted in all the newspapers offering that amount to any head of a household who would prove personally or otherwise that his household had been overlooked. This was perhaps as severe a mode as could be devised of testing the completeness of the returns, and the fact of only a few omissions being proved affords satisfactory evidence that the sub-enumerators had done their work efficiently. A number of applications were made in pursuance of this advertisement, but upon the cases being inquired into it was found that many of them were entirely groundless, and evidently had only been submitted for the purpose of obtaining the reward. In every case where it appeared a house had really been overlooked, the Ten shillings was at once paid, but the whole number of rewards amounted only to 81, so that at the expense of £40 10s. the Government and the country were placed in possession of the strongest presumptive evidence that the Census had been properly taken. It is doubtful whether in any country except Victoria the completeness of the Census-taking
						<span class="annotation"> [Reward for reporting omissions.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_11"></div>
			<p>had ever been subjected to so conclusive a test. It had once previously been tried here—viz., in 1871—when, upon the same reward being offered, the substantiated claims for reporting omissions amounted to exactly 100, or 19 more than on this occasion. The persons who reported they had been overlooked were frequently isolated individuals, living alone in out-of-the-way places ; but, supposing each to represent a dwelling containing three persons, the total would amount to 300 individuals in 1871, and 243 in 1881, or 1 person in every 2,438 of the population at the former, and 1 person in every 3,549 at the latter period, both of which proportions must be considered extremely small.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">34.</h3>
				<p>The omissions reported both before and after the reward was offered may be reduced to two classes, the first and most numerous being in town, where places appearing to be out-houses, situated in the back-yards of dwellings and in lanes and rights-of-way were not recognized by the sub-enumerators as independent habitations, and consequently were not visited ; and the second in the country, where dwellings situated about the line of division between two enumerators' districts—the line perhaps running on top of a dividing range, or being otherwise badly defined—were supposed by the sub-enumerator on each side to be in the other's district, and consequently were returned by neither. In very few cases indeed could the omissions be said to arise from neglect or carelessness on the part of the sub-enumerators. It is impossible, under any system of census-taking to guard against some omissions taking place ; it is believed, however, that, owing to the precautions described, the persons eventually overlooked have been so few as not to be worth mentioning.</p>

				<p>In the colony of Queensland it is customary to add 2½ per cent.<div class="footnote">
						<p>By Mr. Jordan's Census Report, issued since my correspondence with him, I find that, on the present occasion, he proposes to add only 1½ per cent. to the enumerated population of Queensland.</p>
					</div>to the enumerated population to allow for omissions. It is difficult to conceive, however, that under any well devised system of census-collection so large a proportion of the population could really be overlooked. Mr. H. Jordan, the Registrar-General of that colony, informs<span class="paragraph-note">Illegible</span>it is considered necessary to make this allowance in consequence of persons being<span class="paragraph-note">Illegible</span>to be missed, owing to their being scattered over so wide an extent of territory as is embraced within the limits of Queensland. Without at all questioning the propriety of the arrangements it is deemed desirable to make in another colony, I may mention that the reason given is altogether opposed to my own experience, which tends to show that, in thinly peopled localities, the existence of small parties of splitters or prospectors, or even of single individuals, is always well known for miles round in every direction, and that, as a sub-enumerator visiting the district would be sure to be informed of them, it is not in such places that omissions are apt

I need scarcely say that in Victoria no persons are ever included in the returns who have not been actually enumerated, or of whose existence direct evidence has not been obtained.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">36.</h3>
				<p>By the Census Act, as I have already stated,<div class="footnote">
						<p>See paragraphs 6 to 8<span class="emphasis">ante.</span></p>
					</div>persons refusing to fill up or to supply information for filling up the schedules rendered themselves liable to pecuniary penalties. It was not, however, found necessary to enforce these in a single case. A few instances of refusal occurred, generally in the case of the returns of live stock or of the operations of manufactories, but the individuals refusing invariably yielded when informed by the enumerator or the department of what the consequences of persistent resistance would be, and on its being made plain to them that the information would be treated as strictly confidential, and would be made use of only for statistical purposes, and in combination with other returns of a similar nature in such a form as not to afford a clue to the operations of any establishment or individual. Indeed it was found that the difficulty generally arose from defective tact or want of proper explanation on the part of the sub-enumerators, rather than from any wish to refuse compliance with the law.
						<span class="annotation"> [Refusal to supply information.] </span>

				<p>The night fixed for the Census was that of Sunday the 3rd April 1881. By the Census Act the schedules were to be deposited within the ten days immediately preceding that date and to be recovered as soon as possible afterwards.
						<span class="annotation"> [Date of Census.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">38.</h3>
				<p>To guard against the possibility of sub-enumerators depositing schedules at houses, and failing to recover them, each sub-enumerator was obliged to keep a strict account, in accordance with a form supplied to him, of the number of schedules he received, and the manner in which they were disposed of, and to return all unused schedules to the enumerator.
						<span class="annotation"> [Account of schedules.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">39.</h3>
				<p>Before giving in their returns to the enumerator, each sub-enumerator was required to copy from the householders' schedules he collected the totals of the population, distinguishing the sexes and the Chinese and Aborigines, into the pages of a book supplied him for that purpose, and to make a summary of the results and of the number of houses in his sub-district, whether inhabited, uninhabited, or in course of erection. From these summaries the enumerator then made out a table on a form entitled "Enumerator's Schedule C," embodying a statement of the total number of persons and houses in his district, and this he forwarded at once to the Government Statist. Every exertion was used to get these statements from the enumerators as quickly as possible, and as soon as all were received a rough summary of the results was published in the<span class="emphasis">Government Gazette</span>
						<span class="annotation"> [Arrangements for speedy publication of Census results.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_13"></div>
			<p>for general information. This summary appeared on the 4th May, or just one month after the Census day, and a second return, containing ten tables made up from the same summaries, giving copious details of the European, Chinese, and Aboriginal population in the counties, electoral provinces, electoral districts, shires, cities, towns and boroughs, as well as comparisons with former Censuses, was sent to the printer on the 23rd May, and was laid before Parliament a few days after. It may be stated that, in this respect, the arrangements were perfectly successful, and resulted in the approximate gross results of the Census being made public in a shorter time from the date of its collection than had ever previously been the case in Victoria, and fully a fortnight sooner than any, and many weeks sooner than some, of the other Australasian colonies (in all of which the Census was taken on the same day as in Victoria) were able to issue any of their results.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">40.</h3>
				<p>As soon as the sub-enumerators of any district had completed their returns, all who were willing to accept payment for the time which the enumerator had set down beforehand as sufficient for their work were paid at once, but much delay occurred over the payment of the others, mainly in consequence of the exorbitant claims many of them sent in. As it is difficult to foresee exactly the time the collection within a certain area ought to take, and as, moreover, circumstances might arise to delay the completion of the work, a clause had been inserted in the sub-enumerators' instructions to the effect that, if the time allowed should prove insufficient, the enumerator's recommendation for additional payment would be duly considered. This clause was the occasion of much mischief, as, out of the sub-enumerators employed, numbering nearly 1,900, fully 1,500 professed themselves unable to complete their work in the time allotted them, and claimed extra payment. Some of these claims were perfectly justified by the circumstances, but others were as groundless. The merits of every claim were carefully examined into by the Government Statist personally, and a great deal of valuable time, which could ill be spared, was devoted to this service. Some of the demands made were quite unreasonable ; the enumerators, as a rule, supported the Government Statist in resisting these, but in a few instances they failed in their duty in this particular and sided with the men, which added greatly to the difficulty of dealing with the cases. Much correspondence ensued, and many months elapsed before all the claims were satisfactorily settled. In view of the difficulty of determining whether a sub-enumerator has worked for a certain number of days, and, if so, whether he has worked honestly, or may not have wasted his time for the purpose of obtaining increased payment by making the collection extend over a longer period, I would strongly recommend that on future occasions of the Census being taken each sub-enumerator should be required to sign an agreement to complete
						<span class="annotation"> [Exorbitant claims of some sub-enumerators.] </span>

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_14"></div>
			<p>his district in a certain number of days, to be arranged beforehand between him and the enumerator, and approved by the Government Statist, the clear understanding being, that if he should complete his work in less time than the agreement specified he should still receive the stipulated amount, but if he should take longer no further payment should be made. Provision should at the same time be made for penalties in the case of any sub-enumerator leaving his work unfinished, whether he might be able to complete it in the stated time or not, and for withholding payment altogether until the work was done in a satisfactory manner.</p>

				<p>The cost of taking the Census on the last four occasions, so far as the payments to enumerators and sub-enumerators were concerned, was as follows.

An elaborate code of office regulations and instructions, designed to give full information as to the method of compiling the returns and to provide a solution for every point of difficulty likely to arise, had previously been drawn up by the Government Statist, and a copy was placed in the hands of each officer.</p>

				<p>That some members of a staff so hastily improvised as that engaged for the compilation of a Census should be found unfitted for the work is perhaps inevitable. No Minister has the leisure to scrutinize closely the capabilities of every candidate, and is sorely tempted to appoint persons urged to his notice by political supporters, who are perhaps eloquent as to the good qualities but silent as to the faults of those in whom they are interested. I submit, however, that it is only due to the officer charged with the conduct of the work, who is expected to produce the best results with as small an expenditure of funds as possible, that he should be empowered to dispense with the services of those who, from intemperate habits, mental incapacity, or defective education, prove themselves unfitted for their position ; or who by disobedience of orders or insubordinate conduct interfere with the discipline of the office. Were this latitude, for the fair and impartial exercise of which he might and ought to be held strictly responsible, allowed to the Government Statist, the results of the Census would be produced in a much shorter time and at a greatly reduced cost.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">46.</h3>
				<p>An Intercolonial Statistical Conference, at which Victoria was represented by the present writer, was held in Tasmania in the early part of 1875, its object being to arrange that the official statistics of the different colonies should, as far as possible, be compiled upon a uniform system. The matter of Census compilation came under discussion at this conference, but the members felt that, in view of the length of time likely to elapse before a Census would be taken, they were unable to deal with the subject in a satisfactory manner, more especially as any changes which might be made in the columns of the householder's schedule might render their labors incomplete and perhaps useless. They, therefore, so far as this matter was concerned, confined themselves to a general resolution to the effect that it was desirable the compilation of the Census should accord in all essential particulars with the system
						<span class="annotation"> [Attempts to secure uniformity through-out Australasia.] </span>

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_16"></div>
			<p>in use in the United Kingdom, it being generally understood that an effort should be made prior to the taking of another Census to bring about a second conference for the purpose of settling the details of its compilation. Accordingly, towards the close of 1879, unofficial communications were opened up between the heads of the Statistical Departments in the different colonies, it being their unanimous wish that such a conference should take place in New South Wales, in the early part of the following year, the time being a particularly favorable one, as the Sydney International Exhibition would be open, and several of them contemplated visiting Sydney upon that occasion at any rate. Of course the invitation to the conference must come from the colony in which it was to be held, and accordingly Mr. E. G. Ward, the Registrar-General of New South Wales, was requested to urge the matter upon his Government, which he promised to do, and as much as possible to further the object sought to be attained. No result, however, came from Mr. Ward's efforts ; he stated he brought the subject repeatedly before the Government of New South Wales, but they were opposed to such a conference being held, and so the matter was necessarily abandoned. Subsequently, about the close of 1880, an attempt was made to bring about a conference in Melbourne, but too late, as the forms for the Census compilation had already been printed in most of the colonies ; and besides, the Census being so near at hand, the principal officers of the Statistical Departments were unable to be absent from their posts, and thus it resulted that no conference was held. This is doubtless to be regretted, although in the case of most of the colonies it has been found possible to secure an approach to uniformity by other means. An officer from Queensland and one from Tasmania, sent I believe by their respective Governments, visited Melbourne some months before the Census was taken, for the purpose of consulting with the Government Statist of Victoria on the subject of Census compilation, and at once agreed to adopt his forms and methods, which had been based as far as possible upon those used in connection with the Census of England and Wales. New Zealand had been entirely in accord with Victoria in this matter since 1873.<div class="footnote">
					<p>The present writer visited New Zealand in that year, and, at the request of the Government of that colony, investigated the working of the Statistical Department, and made suggestions for its improvement, and for the better taking and compilation of the Census, all of which were adopted.</p>
				</div>Other colonies applied by letter for an explanation of the methods in use here, and ultimately adopted the major portion of them ; the only colony continuing to stand aloof as regards material points being New South Wales, the Census tables of which, especially those relating to the occupations of the people, differ widely from those of Victoria and the other colonies. The latter have throughout evinced every desire to assimilate their systems with the system in use here, the differences which still exist being only in minor</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_17"></div>
			<p>matters of detail, which could scarcely be satisfactorily settled except at a conference.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">47.</h3>
				<p>The work of compiling the returns of a Census is always a laborious one. In order to produce the figures contained in the tables presented to Parliament it is necessary to enter, copy, check, and re-check hundreds of thousands of other figures which never meet the public eye, and the very existence of which is unknown beyond the precincts of the Census office. This will be better realized when it is remembered that there are seven principal heads of inquiry, viz., Inhabitants and Houses, Birthplaces, Religions, Ages, Occupations, Conjugal Condition, and Education ; and the numbers of the population of either sex in the counties, electoral provinces, electoral districts, cities, towns, boroughs, shires, goldworkings, and all other aggregations of population throughout the colony must be got out under each of these heads with so much exactness that the results in every case balance with each other to a unit ; that besides these there are a number of minor heads of inquiry subsidiary to the principal heads, relating to sickness and infirmity, special particulars respecting Chinese and Aborigines, persons in hospitals, asylums and gaols, employers, employed and unemployed, husbands and wives, graduates of universities, and a variety of other matters ; that there are also computations to be made—many of them of a difficult and complicated character, but on which much of the usefulness of a Census depends—to show averages, percentages, comparisons with former Censuses and with those of other countries ; and when it is remembered that the interval between two Censuses in Victoria being ten years, most if not all the persons employed on one Census have disappeared before the next one takes place, and fresh officers have to be taught duties for which many of them possess no natural or acquired qualification whatever, it will readily be believed that the work is one which imposes a heavy tax upon the energies of those whose duty it is to plan and superintend it.
						<span class="annotation"> [Compilation of Census returns.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">48.</h3>
				<p>Before commencing to tabulate the Census returns it was necessary that the schedules should be arranged in order, those relating to each place it was desired to distinguish being kept separate from the others in the same bundle by means of sheets of paper labeled with the name of the county, electoral district, electoral province, parish, city, town, borough, or shire, ward or riding, township, village, or goldfield. When the arrangement of the schedules was completed, these were paged with a numbering machine, a number commencing afresh in each county with No. 1 being assigned to each place, and then the first tabulation, "Inhabitants and Houses," was commenced. For this tabulation the information was extracted from the schedules upon sheets having columns ruled for the purpose, but all the succeeding tabulations were effected by means of cards.</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_18"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">49.</h3>
				<p>The card system had been used for some years in the department of the Government Statist in the compilation of returns of marriages and deaths, the criminal statistics, and the valuations of friendly societies, but had never been employed here, nor, so far as I am aware, in any other country on the compilation of a Census. I had, however, been so satisfied with the system, in regard to the work which had already been done by it, that I determined on this occasion to extend its operation to the Census.
						<span class="annotation"> [Card system of compilation.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">50.</h3>
				<p>The so-called cards were not made of card-board but of thick paper, and were about the size of ordinary playing-cards. For their custody and arrangement nests of pigeon holes were provided, constructed to stand on tables. These nests were 3 feet high, 3 feet 8 inches long, and 4½ inches deep, and contained fixed partitions 4 inches—or a little more than the width of the cards—apart, and movable cross shelves constructed to slide in and out between the partitions, through grooves placed every 2 inches apart, so that a large or a small space could be obtained, according as it was required to place a greater or less number of cards therein. These pigeon holes were intended for the cards actually being dealt with, but for those not in use for the time being a small room was fitted up with pigeon holes of various capacities fixed around it from floor to ceiling. A careful officer was placed in charge of this room, whose duty it was to see that the cards were put away in perfect order, so that he could at once lay hands on any which might be required. It will readily be understood that it would have been a serious matter if the cards, numbering, as they did, nearly 900,000, had been allowed to become disordered or misplaced, and that upon the perfection of the methods adopted for the arrangement and disposal of the cards much of the success of the card system depends.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">51.</h3>
				<p>The process of using the cards may be briefly described. One card is devoted to each individual enumerated, viz., a white card to each male and a pink card to each female, so that 452,083 of the former and 410,263 of the latter were employed. On each card the name of the county and number of the place are stamped with indiarubber stamps provided for the purpose, then the number of the schedule and the various particulars it contains respecting the individual to which the card relates are entered with pen and ink. After the entries are made and their correctness has been verified by examination, the next proceeding is to reduce the results to a tabular form. This is done by sorting the cards of each place into heaps, according to whatever head of inquiry it is desired to work out. Thus, in the case of the religions, say in the portion of La Trobe ward of the city of Melbourne situated in the electoral district of Richmond, the cards of the members of the Church of England are got together, also those of the Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Wesleyans, &amp;c.,</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_19"></div>
			<p>after which it is only necessary to count the cards in each heap, and to enter the numbers so obtained in the columns of specially prepared summary sheets. A precisely similar course is pursued in the case of the birthplaces, ages, education, conjugal condition, and occupations, after the last of which is completed, cards containing particulars it is desired to tabulate separately are thrown out from the others. These, on this occasion, embraced all those relating to Austro-Hungarian and Italian subjects (of which special information had been promised to their respective Governments), Chinese, Aborigines, persons laid up by reason of sickness or infirmity, miners who stated their former occupations, unemployed persons, masters who stated the number of hands they employed, university graduates, husbands and wives whose consorts were absent, and inmates of charitable and penal institutions. The thrown-out cards are afterwards dealt with in the manner already described in regard to those relating to the principal heads of inquiry.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">52.</h3>
				<p>The tabulation of a Census by means of cards being, as I have already stated, entirely novel, it is only reasonable to suppose that many improvements in the method of procedure suggested themselves in the course of the operation, and all these have been carefully noted, for the guidance of those charged with the conduct of future Censuses. One of these is to obviate the necessity of throwing out the cards by providing cards of a third color (not white or pink), on which duplicates could be made of those cards containing information it is desired to extract specially. This would enable the work of tabulating such information to be proceeded with simultaneously with that connected with the larger returns, and would also render it unnecessary to interfere with the arrangement of the original cards.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">53.</h3>
				<p>After the contents of the cards have been arranged in a tabular form in the manner described, much work still remains to be done, especially in combining the information relating to fragments of places so as to show such places as a whole, in preparing subsidiary tables, and in copying the digested returns into forms specially arranged for publication. In these operations, summary after summary and abstract after abstract have to be written out, numbers of heavy additions and other more abstruse calculations have to be made, and the whole has at each step to be called over, checked and re-checked, so as, if possible, to preclude any chance of a mistake remaining undetected.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">54.</h3>
				<p>In all operations connected with the Census under review mechanical appliances were used where possible, and by means of these much saving of clerical labor has been effected. I would particularly mention Edison's electric pen, which, as an instrument for multiplying copies of written documents, is perhaps unequalled ; numbering machines of simple and correct action, specially made to the order of

			<p>Messrs. Semple and Ramsay of Melbourne ; also a French calculating machine, designated<span class="emphasis">L'Arithmometre,</span>by Thomas de Colmar of Paris.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">55.</h3>
				<p>The first Census part, Inhabitants and Houses, is the only one in which detailed returns of the wards, ridings, towns, townships, villages, &amp;c., throughout the colony have been published in full. Under the other heads of inquiry, in order to save time and expense, the printing has been confined to summaries showing the numbers in each county, electoral province, electoral district, shire, city, town, borough, and mining district. Tabular results, however, giving the same details as those contained in Part I. have been written out fairly, and are available for public reference in this office.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">57.</h3>
				<p>The previous Census had been taken on the 2nd April 1871, when the enumerated population amounted to 731,528, viz., 401,050 males and 330,478 females. The increase in the period between the two enumerations was thus 130,818, consisting of 51,033 males and 79,785 females.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">58.</h3>
				<p>Between the Censuses of 1871 and 1881 the excess of registered births over registered deaths was 145,903, viz., 66,923 of males and 78,980 of females. If the colony had retained the whole of this natural increase, the Census would have shown 15,890 more males than it did. It did show females equal in numbers to the natural increase and 805 more, and it thus resulted that the total increase of both sexes was less by 15,085 than the natural increase.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">59.</h3>
				<p>In the same ten years the excess of recorded arrivals over recorded departures by sea was 52,352, viz., 39,314 males and 13,038 females. These numbers being added to those just given showing the excess of registered births over registered deaths, the apparent increase of population between the Censuses will be found to be 198,255, viz., 106,237 males and 92,018 females. The increase actually shown by the Census of 1881 was, however, less than these numbers by 67,437, viz., 55,204 males and 12,233 females.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">60.</h3>
				<p>It being very generally known that no record was or could be taken of the arrivals in and departures from Victoria overland, it was at first thought that the missing individuals had crossed the frontiers to the adjacent colonies ; but when the</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_21"></div>
			<p>published Census returns of the neighboring colonies showed a deficiency of a similar character, although less in degree, to exist in New South Wales and Queensland, which was only partly compensated by a small surplus in South Australia, it was at once realized that this supposition failed to account for the loss. The following is a statement of the exact deficiency or surplus in the colonies named :—</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">61.</h3>
				<p>The simultaneous Census of the colonies thus discloses the astonishing fact that—whilst an exact record is professed to be kept in each colony of the arrivals and departures by the seaboard—in the ten years 1871 to 1881 over 101,000 persons, or about 1 in 18 of the average population of the four colonies, seem to have left the Australian continent unobserved. The registration of deaths in all the colonies is known to be more perfect than that of births, therefore, from this cause, a surplus instead of a deficiency might be expected ; the solution of the difficulty must therefore be looked for either in the inaccuracy of the returns of the Census or of those of emigration.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">62.</h3>
				<p>It is extremely improbable that the Census of 1881 was imperfect, as in all the colonies it was taken under the supervision of the same department as that which had conducted previous enumerations, and the experience gained would tend to make it the most perfect of any. For this reason, if persons were missed at either of the last two Censuses, the chances are that they were so in 1871 rather than in 1881,</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_22"></div>
			<p>and this should go towards causing the population enumerated at the latter period to be above rather than under the estimate.<div class="footnote">
					<p>I am aware it was asserted in the Parliament of New South Wales that the Census of that colony had been incorrectly taken, and this fact was admitted by Sir John Robertson, the Acting Premier ; but the inaccuracy, so far as I understand, was only stated to apply to the distribution of the inhabitants of the colony in rural districts and towns, not to the numbers of the population taken as a whole. (See report of a debate in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, 21st September 1882, on a motion of adjournment by Mr. J. P. Abbott.)</p>

				<p>The question of the accuracy of the returns kept by the Immigration authorities was inquired into by the Statistical Conference of representatives of the Australasian colonies held in Tasmania in 1875,<div class="footnote">
						<p>See Report of Conference of Government Statists, resolution 4, page 9, and introductory letter to the same by the Government Statist of Victoria, paragraph 14, page 6, Parliamentary Paper No. 11, Session 1875.</p>
					</div>when it was found that, whilst a sufficiently correct account was kept of all persons arriving in each colony, also of those departing to distant countries, the records of persons leaving one colony to go to another were very imperfect. This was mainly due to the fact that many persons traveling between the colonies omitted to take their passages beforehand, with the effect that their names did not appear in the lists supplied by the shipping agents at the colony of departure, whereas they were duly entered in those supplied at the colony of arrival, the consequence being that they were added to the estimated population of the latter without being deducted from that of the former. This has since often been referred to officially by me,<div class="footnote">

					</div>and has been the occasion of some correspondence between this department and that of the immigration agent in Melbourne. I am assured that, so far as Victoria is concerned, the evil is much less than it used to be ; but from inquiries I have made at the offices of the intercolonial steamers, I am led to believe that it still exists to a certain extent, and that at the present time several thousand persons leave the colony each year without being noted.</p>

				<p>I have made an attempt to ascertain the number of unrecorded persons who left Victoria by sea in the interval between the Censuses of 1871 and 1881, by comparing the numbers recorded as arriving in the neighboring colonies from Victoria by the seaboard with those who were known to leave Victoria for those colonies by that mode of exit in the same period. In this I was quite successful, so far as New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, and New Zealand were concerned ; but I failed to get reliable information respecting South Australia and Western Australia, chiefly, I believe, in consequence of the returns being complicated by entries of persons who left Victoria for England and the East<span class="emphasis">vid</span>those colonies, which I found it impossible to separate from entries of persons traveling by the same steamers who were going to remain in Australia.

				<p>It is thus seen that in the interval between the last two Censuses 214,730 persons were recorded as leaving Victoria for the four colonies named, but as many as 245,825 persons, or 31,095 more, were recorded as arriving from Victoria in those colonies. The recorded departures from Victoria in the same period for South Australia and Western Australia numbered 63,706, which I have already stated I find it impossible to reconcile with the recorded arrivals from Victoria thereat. From inquiries, however, I have made of the agents and captains of the steamers trading to the western colonies, I find that the evil complained of exists in that direction to just as great an extent as it does in the case of the colonies of which the returns are available ; therefore, applying the same proportion to the recorded departures for the former as has been found to apply to those for the latter, it may be assumed that 8,995 unrecorded persons left this colony for South Australia and Western Australia in the ten years' interval. The following would therefore be the estimate of persons who left by the seaboard during the ten years intervening between the Censuses of 1871 and 1881 without their departure being noted by the Immigration authorities :—</p>

Of these it may be assumed from the above figures that 40,090, or an average of 4,000 annually, went away by sea, and 27,347, or 2,700 annually, left by land. Of the latter it was always known that no note could be taken, but the unrecorded departure of so large a number of persons by sea has been a circumstance altogether unexpected until brought to light by the Census.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">67.</h3>
				<p>The remarks applicable to Victoria in this respect apply with equal force to the other Australian colonies, in the whole of which the same system exists of taking a complete account of the arrivals, but a defective one of the departures. This is proved in the case of New South Wales and Queensland by the large deficiencies (amounting in the aggregate to over 44,000) found to exist in their Census populations as compared with the estimates, which can be set down to no other cause. These deficiencies would no doubt have been greater if those colonies had not gained largely, just as Victoria had lost considerably, by persons crossing the borders. Until some principle is adopted whereby the departures by sea are noted with the same accuracy as the arrivals, it must be expected at each Census that the returns of the population of the Australian continent will be much smaller than had been anticipated.</p>

				<p>In all the colonies on the Australian continent the enumeration of the Aborigines was incomplete. This is of little importance, so far as this colony is concerned, the numbers here being so small. In New South Wales only the "civilized" Aborigines were returned, which probably represent only a small portion of the whole ; in Queensland only a few Aborigines were returned in the first instance, but an estimate was subsequently made by officers of the Police Department, and the Census figures have been supplemented by the numbers so obtained ; the figures for South Australia do not include the Aborigines in the Northern Territory ; and those for Western Australia only relate to the Aborigines in service. No Aborigines remain on the island of Tasmania.<div class="footnote">
						<p>Mr. R. M. Johnston, who has recently succeeded Mr. E. C. Nowell as Government Statistician of Tasmania, writes—"The last male of the Tasmanian Aboriginals died on the 3rd March 1869, and the last of the race (<span class="emphasis">Trucaninni,</span>a female) died at Hobart on the 8th May 1876. On the islands of Bass's Straits (Barren and Badger) there are a few families of half-castes who live in a miserable sort of way ; catching mutton birds and boiling them down for oil seems to be their principal occupation. Although the men are strong and vigorous, and excelling as boatmen, they are extremely improvident and lazy. So far as I can learn, these half-castes are mixed, and are quite as much related to the natives of continental Australia as they are to the Aborigines of Tasmania."</p>

He writes as follows in his report on the Census :—"In the northern parts of the colony they are comparatively numerous, and some persons resident in the Cook and Palmer districts have supposed there may be 70,000 Aborigines in Queensland. This, however, is a very crude estimate, and may be far wide of the truth."] </span>

Brown, Registrar-General of New Zealand, writes as follows respecting the enumeration of the Maoris :—"An attempt was made in 1881 to obtain a correct enumeration of the native population, but although the officers of the Native Department who had the charge of the enumeration do not think that there are any material errors in the results obtained, yet they agree in stating that the numbers given are correct, and in many instances only estimates. In some parts no access was permitted to those destrous of obtaining information. In parts the natives showed a suspicion of the enumerators, and a growing distinclination to have their numbers known, and information relating thereto was refused. Difficulty was also experienced on account of the nomadic habits of portions of the tribes ; and in some instances the natives who were at a distance from their tribes were enumerated in in loco and given again by another officer among the numer of their tribe. The total number is greater by 502 than that returned at the Census of 1878 ; but as the reports of the native officers generally point to a perceptible decrease in the Maori population, this apparent increase may be attributable to a better enumeration on the present occasion."] </span>

				<p>During the interval between the Censuses of 1871 and 1881 the increase of the total population of Victoria was 18 per cent., the increase in the male population was 13 per cent., and the increase in the female population was 24 per cent.
						<span class="annotation"> [Increase of population.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">74.</h3>
				<p>Between the Censuses of 1861 and 1871 the total population increased in the proportion of 35 per cent., or nearly double the rate at which it increased between 1871 and 1881. Between previous Censuses the increase was still greater. In the four years from 1857 to 1861 it was in the proportion of 32 per cent., in the three years from 1854 to 1857 it was in the proportion of 73 per cent., and in the three years from 1851 to 1854 it was in the proportion of 206 per cent.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">75.</h3>
				<p>The increase of population between 1871 and 1881 was, as may be supposed, greatest in the metropolitan county of Bourke, where it amounted to 70,804, or more than half the total increase in the colony. After this it was greatest in the counties most largely peopled by land selectors. Thus the increase in Moira amounted to 19,420, in Borung to 16,017, in Rodney to 10,769, in Buln Buln to</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_27"></div>
			<p>7,340, and in Tangil to 4,278. In the county of Bendigo the increase was 10,544, but in most of the other goldfield counties, as well as in some of the older settled agricultural counties, the population decreased. In Talbot there was a falling-off of 16,799, in Grenville of 16,758, in Grant of 7,655, in Dalhousie of 5,096, in Bogong of 2,800, in Ripon of 1,669, in Wonnangatta of 1,131, in Villiers of 280, and in Karkarooc of 215. In Hampden, males were fewer by 51 than in 1871, but females being more numerous by 132, the whole county showed an increase of 81 inhabitants.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">76.</h3>
				<p>The shipping in Victorian waters contained fewer males by 467 than in 1871, but, as there were 61 more females, the total diminution of the floating population was reduced to 406.</p>

				<p>Omitting a few thinly-peopled districts, municipal government extends over the whole of Victoria. The territory not embraced in municipalities covered 14,000 square miles in 1871, but only about 6,000 square miles in 1881 ; the inhabitants of the extra-municipal portions numbered 11,531 at the former and 7,818 at the latter period.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">78.</h3>
				<p>The municipalities are of two kinds, urban and rural ; the former being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the latter shires. In 1881, the urban municipalities contained rather more inhabitants than the rural ones, the numbers being respectively 434,467 and 420,061. In 1871, also, the cities, towns, and boroughs were slightly more populous than the shires, the numbers in the former being 374,150, and in the latter 345,847.

				<p>In 1881, the shires embraced nine townships which were boroughs in 1871, but had since ceased to be such.<div class="footnote">
						<p>These towns are Beechworth, Chiltern, Graytown, Guildford, Jamieson, Kilmore, South Barwon, Steiglitz, and Woodend.</p>
					</div>The population within the limits of these, as ascertained in 1881, has, however, been separated for the purpose of making comparison with the former period. Adding the population of these places, also that of the borough of Walhalla, which was created between the last two Censuses, to the population of the other cities, towns, and boroughs as returned in 1881, the whole urban population in that year is found to have amounted to 444,193, as against 374,150 in 1871, the proportion to the total population being about 51 per cent. at both periods.</p>

				<p>Melbourne within its corporate limits is more than twice as populous as any other municipality in Victoria, but the city comprises only a small portion of the metropolis, or "Greater Melbourne" as it may be called, which may be considered to extend in all directions for a distance of ten miles from the Melbourne Post Office, and comprises 16 urban municipalities besides several townships and villages which still form portions of shires. The population within this area, which is being rapidly covered with houses, amounted when the Census was taken to 282,947, as against 206,780 in 1871. The increase within the periods was thus 76,167, or at the rate of 37 per cent. It has been stated already that the increase of the total population was at the rate of only 18 per cent., so that the metropolitan population increased in a much larger ratio than the general population.

In 22 out of the 55 districts the electors on the roll exceeded the number of such males. This was partly in consequence of some persons possessing votes in districts other than those in which they resided, partly by reason of the deaths or removals of electors, and partly in consequence of the names of the Chinese ratepayers being still on the electoral roll.

				<p>The relation the inhabitants bear to the area of a country, or to any of its divisions, may be expressed in three ways, viz., first by what is termed the density of the population, secondly by its so-called areality, and thirdly by its so-called proximity.
						<span class="annotation"> [Density, areality, and proximity.] </span>

			<p>mile<div class="footnote">
					<p>These areas would only be the most convenient when making calculations relating to the country as a whole, or to any of its larger divisions, such as counties, shires, &amp;c. In towns, it would be necessary to use smaller areas,<span class="emphasis">e.g.,</span>acres or roods for the density, and square yards for the areality.</p>
				</div>; the areality is ascertained by finding the average number of smaller areas, the most convenient being acres, (1) to each person ; the proximity is found by calculating the mean distance between person and person.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">113.</h3>
				<p>In Victoria, excluding the persons in ships and vessels, the number of persons to the square mile (density) was 9.791, or nearly 98 persons to 10 square miles ; the number of acres to each person (areality) was about 65frac13; (65.364).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">114.</h3>
				<p>In considering the mean proximity of the inhabitants of a country or district, they must be imagined to be placed at equal distances apart over its entire area ; when their proximity would be the distance between one person and another, or the extent of ground each would have to travel over to reach his next neighbors.<div class="footnote">
						<p>The following explanation of the manner in which the mean proximity of the population has been calculated is by Mr. E. F. Owen, the actuary for Friendly Societies attached to this department :—</p>
					</div>The</p>
			
			<p>In presenting an idea of th erelative populousness of the different districts fo the colony under the form of the comparative proximity of the people, each county is supposed to be divided equally among the persons residing within its boundary, and each person to stand in the middle of his allotment, the shape of which being of necessity in such as case that of a regular figure of six equal sides or hexagon, as shown inthe diagram.</p>
			<div class="figure"><h3 class="figure-title">
        </h3><p class="figure-description">figure</p></div>
			<p>The manner in which the quantities in the last column of the following table were obtained will be readily understood form the following explanation :—</p>
			<p>The area<span class="emphasis">a</span>of each person's allotment was first found in yards by dividing the area of the whole county A by the number of persons in it, P, thus<span class="emphasis">a</span>=<span class="media"></span>The distance<span class="emphasis">d</span>separating each pair of neighbours will be seen by reference to the diagrams to be double th eapotherm<span class="emphasis">p</span>,<span class="emphasis">i.e.,</span>the line drawn form the centre of the hexagon to bisect a side perpendicularly.</p>
			<p>In the diagram, P is the perpendicular or the right-angled triangle h p b, which is half of one of the six equilateral triangles into which the hexagon is divided ; b is the base of the same triangle, h the hypotenuse, and obviously<span class="media"></span>, By Euclid I. 47,<span class="media"></span>, and therefore<span class="media"></span>, consequently<span class="media"></span>, By Euclid I. 41, the area of the equilateral traiangle<span class="media"></span>, and the area of the hexagon<span class="media"></span>, therefore<span class="media"></span>and the distance<span class="media"></span></p>

			<p>This expression for the distance may be put in a form better adapted for calculation, for<span class="media"></span></p>
			<p>The distance apart was thus found in each case by multiplying the number of square yards in each person's hexagonal allotment by 1.1547005, and extracting the square root of the product.</p>
			<p>The relation of the quantities may be exhibited in another form which may perhaps prove useful. Since<span class="media"></span>where<span class="media"></span>and , a result which may be thus expressed :—</p>
			<p>The number of persons it would be necessary to assign to a district in order that they might stand at any given distance apart will be found by dividing the area of the distsrict by the square of the given distance and multiplying the quotient by the square root of 1 , that is by 1.1547.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_37"></div>
			<p>result of such a distribution in Victoria would show the mean proximity of the land population, when the Census was taken, to have been 604½ yards, or about 18 yards more than the third of a mile.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">115.</h3>
				<p>The proximity being dependent upon the same conditions as the areality, and being in fact only another method of denoting the same thing, the two elements will be found to vary in the different counties in the same direction, the ratio of their variation being that of the latter to the square of the former upon the well-known principle of Plane Geometry, that similar figures are to one another in the duplicate ratio of their homologous lines.<div class="footnote">
						<p><span class="emphasis">See</span>Euclid, Book VI., proposition XX.</p>

				<p>It will be noticed that the figures vary widely in the different lines. In Bourke there were as many as 179 persons to the square mile, or only 3<span class="media"></span>; acres to each person, and the inhabitants were on the average only 141½ yards, or less than a twelfth of a mile apart. In Talbot, there were 42 persons to the square mile, 15frac13; acres to each person, and the inhabitants were 292 yards, or a sixth of a mile apart ; in Grant there were 36 persons to the square mile, 17¾ acres to each person, and the inhabitants were 315 yards, or more than a fifth of a mile apart. On the other hand, in Weeah there was only 0.001 of a person to a square mile, or one person to 1,000 square miles or to 640,640 acres, and the 4 inhabitants, if equally scattered over the whole area of the county, would be 59,836 yards, or 34 miles apart. In Karkarooc, in the same manner, there were 22 persons to every 1,000 square miles, 28,337 acres to each person, and an equal distribution of the inhabitants would place 12,584 yards, or more than seven miles, between each and his next neighbour.</p>

				<p>The density of the population is much greater in Victoria than in any of the other Australasian colonies, as will be seen by the following figures, all of which are derived from the returns of the Census of 1881:—

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">118.</h3>
				<p>It is thus seen that the colonies which approached most closely to Victoria in point of density of population are New Zealand and Tasmania, but in the former of these the population is little more than half as dense, and in the latter it is not half as dense as it is in Victoria ; in New South Wales the density is only a quarter as great as in Victoria, whilst in the other three colonies, in which there is only a small fraction of a person to the square mile, the comparison with Victoria is much wider still.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">119.</h3>
				<p>In the continent of Australia, taken as a whole, there was at the Census 0.736 of a person to the square mile, or about 74 persons to 100 square miles ; in Australia, with Tasmania and New Zealand added, there was 0.916 of a person to the square mile, or 92 persons to 100 square miles.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">120.</h3>
				<p>The habitations of all descriptions returned in 1881 numbered 179,816, of which 176,719 were dwelling-houses, 465 were stores, offices, or public buildings in which some person abode on the Census night, and 2,632 were tents. Of the dwelling-houses, 9,049 were unoccupied and 681 were in course of erection. In accordance with previous practice no account was taken of stores or public buildings without resident caretakers.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">121.</h3>
				<p>The material of which 45,615 houses were built was brick or stone ; 115,143 houses were built of wood, iron, or lath and plaster ; 12,604 of the dwellings were huts built of slabs, bark, or mud ; the 2,632 tents were constructed of canvas, linen, or some other textile fabric ; and the materials of 3,822 houses were not specified.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">122.</h3>
				<p>The total number of rooms was 765,339, which were distributed as follows :—13,850 dwellings had one room ; 24,615 had two rooms ; 71,785 had three or four ; 37,687 had five or six ; 24,514 had more than six ; and of 7,365 the number of rooms was not returned.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">123.</h3>
				<p>Between the Censuses of 1871 and 1881 the dwellings of all kinds increased by 21,335, and the inhabited dwellings by 19,468.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">124.</h3>
				<p>It is satisfactory to find that the tendency to build substantial habitations is greater than formerly, for whilst brick and stone houses increased 36 per cent. between the Censuses, wood, iron, and lath and plaster houses increased only 13 per cent. ; and huts and tents actually decreased in numbers, the former by 3,895, and the latter by 2,024.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">125.</h3>
				<p>The superior character of the dwellings in 1881 is also indicated by the number of rooms, for whilst houses of one and two rooms decreased by 6,888 and 8,608 respectively, and houses of three and four rooms increased only 14 per cent., houses of five and six rooms increased 72 per cent., and houses of more than six rooms increased 60 per cent.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">126.</h3>
				<p>In 1881, the average number of rooms to a dwelling was 4.26, as against 3.78 in 1871, 2.79 in 1861, and 2.42 in 1857.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">127.</h3>
				<p>The unoccupied houses amounted to about 5 per cent. of the whole. Of the 9,049 returned, 3,603 were in cities, towns, and boroughs, and 5,381 in shires ; the proportion of vacant houses to the whole number being 4 per cent. in the former and 6 per cent. in the latter. The towns which had the largest number of houses untenanted were Melbourne, with 358 ; Sandhurst, with 317 ; Geelong, with 228 ; Stawell, with 192 ; Prahran, with 162 ; Richmond, with 161 ; Collingwood, with 140 ;

			<p>Fitzroy, with 130 ; Emerald Hill, with 120 ; and St. Kilda, with 110. The shires which contained the largest number of unoccupied houses were Echuca, with 342 ; Swan Hill, with 238 ; St. Arnaud, with 182 ; Marong, with 161 ; Tullaroop, with 149 ; Waranga, with 120 ; and Ballan, with 115. The enumerator for Horsham, Mr. H. R. Usher, gives an explanation of the reason for there being so many unoccupied houses in his district, which may perhaps account for the same circumstance in other parts of the interior. He writes as follows :—</p>
			<p>"Many of the selectors had left their houses at the time of the taking of the Census for a short time, on account of the dryness of the season and the almost entire absence of water in their immediate localities. Again, in many cases three, four, and five blocks have been taken up by families, the sons or daughters having built upon their selections, intending eventually to reside thereon, but at present residing with their parents. I find, from inquiries which I have instituted, that only about one-third of the number of houses returned as unoccupied can be considered as permanently uninhabited."</p>

				<p>The density, areality, and proximity of the houses in different districts is ascertained in a similar manner to that adopted in order to ascertain the same elements in regard to the population. The following is the result of such a calculation in reference to the former for each county in Victoria and for the entire colony.

				<p>By the figures in the last column it will be seen that, if a sub-enumerator had to leave schedules at, or a rate-collector had to visit, 100 houses of proximity equal to the average of the colony, and he could go straight from house to house, he would have to travel 77 miles and 430 yards ; if equal to the average of Bourke he would have to travel only 18 miles and 1,180 yards ; but if equal to the average of Karkarooc he would have to travel as much as 1,342 miles and 1,240 yards, and if equal to the average of Croajingolong he would have to travel 594 miles and 650 yards, &amp;c.</p>

				<p>At the Census of 1881, 818,843 persons, or 95 per cent. of the population, were living in houses properly so called ; 33,858, or less than 4 per cent., were living in slab, bark, or mud huts ; 4,661, or 1 in 185, were living in tents ; 1846, or 1 in 467, were living in ships, and 1,187, or 1 in 726, were camping out. At no previous Census-period since the discovery of gold was the population so well housed as at the one under review. In 1871 less than 93 per cent., in 1861 only 69 per cent., and in 1857, only 63 per cent. of the population were living in houses.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">132.</h3>
				<p>Since the days of the early gold discoveries, an entire change has come over the habits of the population in respect to living in tents. In 1857, 135,866 persons were living in 45,161 tents, and in 1861, 122,877 persons were living in 42,750 tents, whereas in 1871 only 8,660, and in 1881 only 4,661 persons were living in tents ; the number of such habitations being reduced to 4,656 and 2,632.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">133.</h3>
				<p>The persons camping out on the Census night numbered 2,621 in 1861, and 2,661 in 1871, but only 1,846 in 1881.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">134.</h3>
				<p>The persons in ships were fewer in 1881 than at any of the three previous Census-periods. In 1857 there were 3,773 persons afloat in the bays and harbors of the colony, but then several hulks containing prisoners were moored in Hobson's Bay. By 1861, the prison hulks having been abolished, the shipping population had fallen to 1,918 ; this had risen to 2,252 in 1871, but had again fallen to 1,846 in 1881.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">135.</h3>
				<p>As the houses are larger than formerly, so also the average number of persons they contain has increased. In 1881, throughout the colony, the mean</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_42"></div>
			<p>number of persons to an inhabited dwelling was about 5 (5.06) as against 4.84 in 1871, 4.16 in 1861, and 4.21 in 1857.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">136.</h3>
				<p>As a rule there are more people to a house in town than in the country. In 1881 the average number was 5.18 in cities, towns, and boroughs, and 4.94 in shires.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">137.</h3>
				<p>On the goldfields the average number of persons to each habitation was 4.17 in 1871, and 4.56 in 1881.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">138.</h3>
				<p>The total number of rooms in all the houses in the colony was 765,339, and as the population living on land numbered 860,500, there was not one room to each person. The number of persons, however, approached nearer to the number of apartments in 1881 than at former periods, the proportion of persons to a room having been 1.12 as against 1.22 in 1871, 1.44 in 1861, and 1.65 in 1857.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">139.</h3>
				<p>In cities, towns, and boroughs the rooms numbered 414,806, and the persons 434,467, so that the number of rooms approached closely to that of persons. In shires the difference was much greater, there being no more than 347,136 rooms to 420,061 persons. The proportion of persons to each room was 1.05 in the former and 1.21 in the latter.</p>

				<p>On the average, the Chinese are not so well housed as the Europeans, as only 6,832 out of 12,128, or about 56 per cent., were living in houses properly so called. Of the remainder, 5,122 were living in huts, 154 in tents, 12 were camping out, and 8 were in ships.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">141.</h3>
				<p>It has often been confidently asserted that the Chinese crowd together in their dwellings in large numbers, and that, especially in Little Bourke street, Melbourne, and the surrounding lanes and rights-of-way, they congregate so densely as to be a positive source of danger to the health of the rest of the community. To ascertain the truth of this ascertain I have examined the schedules relating to the locality in question and find the statement to be entirely without foundation, there being, on the average, fewer persons in the houses inhabited by Chinese than in those occupied by Europeans. The whole number of persons living in the dwellings represented by the schedules examined was 548, who were spread over 156 houses, containing 637 rooms. There were thus only 3.5 persons to a house, the average of the colony being 5, as already stated, and considerably less than 1 person to a room, the average of the colony being over 1 to a room. Not one of the houses was found to be overcrowded, there being generally no more than from 2 to 4 persons in each. The greatest number returned in any house was 15, the rooms in which (a large building formerly used as a horse bazaar) were set down as numbering 24 ; the next highest numbers were 11 in a nine-roomed house, 11 in a ten-roomed house, and 10 in a six-roomed house.</p>

				<p>Nearly all the Aborigines are now living under shelter. Of the 780 returned, 680 were in houses or huts, and only 100 were camping out. At the Census of 1871 the reverse was the case, as out of 1,330 Aborigines, 739 were camped out, and only 591 were housed or hutted.

It thus appears that 831,547 persons, or 96½ per cent. of the population, were British subjects by birth, and 30,799, or only 3½ per cent., were foreigners.

				<p>As many as 539,060 persons, or 62 per cent. of the population, were natives of the Australasian colonies, and of these, 499,199, or 93 per cent., were born in Victoria ; the proportion of the latter to the whole population was 58 per cent.

				<p>This is the first Census of which the returns showed half the population to be natives of the colony. The Victorian born, in proportion to the whole, amounted only to 45 per cent. in 1871 ; 26 per cent. in 1861 ; 17 per cent. in 1857, and 13 per cent. in 1854.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">148.</h3>
				<p>Of natives of the other Australasian colonies living in Victoria, the most numerous were those of Tasmania, which numbered 11,876 ; then those of South Australia and New South Wales, which numbered respectively, 9,928 and 9,826 ; of New Zealand, which numbered 2,885 ; of Queensland, which numbered 1,120 ; of Western Australia, which numbered 404, and of Fiji, which numbered 95. Besides these, there were 3,727 persons simply stated to have been born in Australia or Australasia, without the name of the colony being mentioned.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">149.</h3>
				<p>Next to the native Australasians, persons born in the United Kingdom formed the largest section of the population. These numbered 282,339, of whom 142,906 were born in England, 86,733 in Ireland, 48,153 in Scotland, and 4,547 in Wales.

				<p>The other British possessions referred to may be divided into European, Asiatic, African, and American. The European possessions comprise Heligoland, Malta, and Gibraltar, which jointly supplied 136 persons to the population ; the Asiatic possessions comprise India, which supplied 998 persons, including 32 of British race, and Ceylon, Burmah, the Straits Settlements, and Hong Kong, which together supplied 132 persons, including one person of British race ; the African possessions comprise the Cape Colony, which supplied 380, the Mauritius, which supplied 169, and Natal, Basutoland, St. Helena, Ascension, and Sierra Leone, which together supplied 89 persons ; the American possessions comprise the Dominion of Canada, which supplied 1,118, the West India Islands, which supplied 432, and Newfoundland, the Bermudas, British Guiana, and the Falkland Islands, which together supplied 110 persons.</p>

				<p>The foreigners by birth may be divided into natives of European, Asiatic, African, American, and Polynesian countries. To the first of these divisions, Germany—which next to China is the foreign nationality most largely represented in the Victorian population—contributed 8,571 persons ; Sweden and Norway, 1,375 ; France, 1,334 ; Switzerland, 1,314 ; Denmark, 1,039 ; Italy, 947 ; Russia, 369 ; Holland and its Dependencies, 342 ; Austria, 323 ; Portugal and its Dependencies, 153 ; Spain and its Dependencies, 148 ; Belgium, 112 ; Greece, 90 ; and Europe (country not named), 194.

To the African group, Egypt contributed 3 ; Madagascar, 2 ; and Africa (country not named), 92. To the American group, the United States—which after China and Germany is the foreign nationality most largely represented—contributed 2,343 ; Brazil, 42 ; Chili, 24 ; Hayti, 6 ; Mexico, 5 ; Peru, 2 ; and South America (country not named), 50. To the Polynesian group, the South Sea Islands contributed 19, and the Sandwich islands, 10. Besides these, 17 foreign subjects were stated to have been born at sea, and of 52 foreigners the place of birth was not stated.</p>

				<p>Between the Censuses of 1871 and 1881 natives of Victoria increased by 169,602. Natives of all the other Australasian colonies, resident in Victoria, also increased in numbers, viz., natives of South Australia by 3,034, of Tasmania by 2,579, of New South Wales by 1,510, of New Zealand by 1,338, of Queensland by 457, of Western Australia by 92, of Fiji by 77, and of Australia or Australasia (colony not named) by 2,087. Natives of almost all countries, outside of Australasia, which found place in our population in 1871, showed smaller numbers in 1881. Natives of England decreased by 21,381, of Wales by 2,067, of Scotland by 8,057, of Ireland by 13,735, of other British Possessions by 1,780, of Germany by 424, of China by 6,058, and of the United States by 80. There were slight increases in the case of France and a few other foreign countries, but in most of the latter the tendency was in the direction of decrease. The total diminution in the number of natives of countries outside of Australasia was 49,958.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">155.</h3>
				<p>The increase of the native Victorians was greater by 21,920 between 1861 and 1871 than between 1871 and 1881, the numbers of Victorian born added to the population in the two intervals respectively being 191,522 and 169,602. The first of these increases was upon a population of 540,322, and was in the proportion of 35 per cent., whilst the second was upon a population of 731,528, and amounted to only 23 per cent.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">156.</h3>
				<p>It is a remarkable fact that amongst natives of all the Australasian colonies, except Queensland and Fiji, resident in Victoria, females were more numerous than males, the net excess of Australasian females over Australasian males being 5,788.

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_46"></div>

On the other hand, males exceeded females in the case of natives of Queensland by 170, and of Fiji by 19.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">157.</h3>
				<p>Besides these instances, the only other important case of the females of any nationality living in Victoria, outnumbering the males of the same nationality, was that of the Irish, amongst whom the excess of females was 4,281.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">158.</h3>
				<p>The following were the proportions of the sexes in every 1,000 persons of different birthplaces living in Victoria :—Victorians, males 496, females 504 ; other Australians, males 479, females 521 ; English, males 578, females 422 ; Welsh, males 609, females 391 ; Scotch, males 545, females 455 ; Irish, males 475, females 525 ; natives of other British possessions, males 643, females 357 ; French, males 781, females 219 ; Germans and Austrians, males 723, females 277 ; Americans, males 702, females 298 ; Chinese, males 995, females 5. Taking British subjects as a whole, the proportions in every 1,000 were—males 512, females 488 ; and taking foreign subjects as a whole, the proportions per 1,000 were—males 861, females 139.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">159.</h3>
				<p>Of the 11,869 Chinese males returned—which include half-castes—126 were set down as being born elsewhere than in the Chinese Empire, viz. :—81 in Victoria, 4 in New South Wales, 38 in the British Possession of Hong Kong,<div class="footnote">
						<p>In the tables of birthplaces published before this report was written, only 19 of the Chinese were set down as born in Hong Kong, but a subsequent investigation has led to the discovery of entries of 19 more.</p>
					</div>and 2 in that of Singapore, and 1 in the Portuguese Possession of Macao. Of the 259 Chinese females (also including half-castes), 203 were stated to have been born outside the Empire, viz., 197 in Victoria, 4 in New South Wales, 1 in Tasmania, and 1 in Hong Kong. It is probable that many more of the Chinese were born in Hong Kong, and possibly a few more in Macao, it being almost certain that some of the sub-enumerators did not realize the necessity of noting the distinction between British or Portuguese China, and China proper.

				<p>All the Aborigines were not natives of Victoria. Of the 460 males, 26 were stated to have been born in New South Wales, 15 in Queensland, and 6 in South Australia.

				<p>Natives of Victoria, backed by Victorian enterprise, energy, skill, and capital, have made their way into every other colony of the group.

			<p>Australasia outside those colonies, have not been shown separately, but have been merely grouped under the head of "Other Australasian Colonies." Judging, however, from the proportions shown in the colonies in which the numbers are known, and from other circumstances, it may fairly be estimated that one-third of those grouped as stated, are natives of Victoria. This would give a total of 539,000 Victorians distributed throughout Australasia, of whom 40,000 were living outside the boundaries of the colony of their birth. These were spread over the different colonies as follow :—</p>

				<p>At the Census under notice, as well as at the two previous Censuses, a statement of religious belief was not made compulsory, persons having a conscientious objection to make such a statement being allowed to enter the word "object" instead. For this reason the information respecting the Religions of the People, although correct as far as it goes, is not quite so complete as that obtained under the other heads.

Children, respecting whom no return of religion was made, were entered as of the religion of their parents if the father and mother were of the same religion, or if the religion of only one parent was stated. If, however, the parents were of widely different denominations, as for instance one being a Protestant and the other a Roman Catholic or a Jew, no assumption was made as to the religion it was intended to bring such children up to, and they were classed with the unspecified ; but if the parents were of different Protestant sects the boys were entered as of the religion of the father, the girls of that of the mother.

				<p>It will be observed that, relatively to their combined numbers, Roman Catholics lost and Protestants gained by a small fraction between the last two Censuses. This is different from the experience between the Censuses of 1861 and 1871, when, in proportion to their joint numbers, Roman Catholics gained and Protestants lost considerably.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">171.</h3>
				<p>Relatively to the total population, both Protestants and Roman Catholics gained slightly between 1871 and 1881, the gain of the former being, however, the greater. Between 1861 and 1871, while Roman Catholics gained considerably in proportion to the population, Protestants lost ground. This loss was, however, more than made up between 1871 and 1881. The following are the proportions to every 10,000 of the total population at the three periods :—</p>

				<p>In accordance with a practice which has always prevailed in Victoria, the persons who returned themselves as Protestants, without any qualification, are classed with members of the Church of England. Their numbers, however, which on this occasion amounted to 11,639, have been kept separate, so that they might be eliminated by any who might disapprove of this classification. The adherents of the Free Church of England, which numbered 110, are also included with the Church of England.

				<p>Partly in consequence of want of accord between the two principal branches of the Presbyterian denomination, and partly from the fact that a large proportion of the members of that church do not use any qualifying term to the word "Presbyterian" when entering their religion in the householder's schedule, there has at each Census been some difficulty in classifying the members of this sect. Before the Census which is the subject of this report was taken, I had some correspondence with the heads of the two branches referred to, viz., the Presbyterian Church of Victoria and the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria, on which occasion I suggested that those who returned themselves simply as Presbyterians might be considered to belong to the former, and those who returned themselves as Free Presbyterians to the latter. The governing body of the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria was willing to accept this arrangement, but not so that of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria,

					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_52"></div>
			<p>and in consequence it became necessary to make four divisions of these two branches of the Presbyterian Church instead of two, which would have sufficed if my proposition had been acceded to. As the figures stand, the Presbyterian Church of Victoria shows a falling-off of no less than 44,677 persons, but if those who were returned as Presbyterians without definition be embodied with these, the numbers would amount to 126,249 and the increase to 33,737. Those who were returned as of the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria fell off largely, as also did those who were returned as Free Presbyterians only, their joint number in 1881 being only 5,748, as against 20,160 in 1871. Besides these Presbyterian bodies, there were, in 1881, Reformed Presbyterians with 114, United Presbyterians with 390, Welsh Presbyterians with 40, Dutch Presbyterians with 3, the Presbyterian Synod of Victoria with 42, the Presbyterian Church of England with 3, and the Puritans with 2 adherents.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">179.</h3>
				<p>By far the largest body of Methodists are the Wesleyans, who numbered 97,115 in 1881, and increased in ten years by 16,624. Then there are Primitive Methodists, who numbered 8,707 and increased by 807 ; United Free Methodists, who numbered 1,625 and increased by 299 ; and New Connection Methodists, who numbered 159 and decreased by 70. Besides these, the returns showed 2 Particular Methodists, 16 Independent Methodists, 17 Welsh Methodists, 5 members of the Wesleyan Free Church, and 747 persons returned simply as Methodists.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">180.</h3>
				<p>Next to the Church of England, the Presbyterians, and the Wesleyans, the most important Protestants sects were as follow :—The Baptists, which in 1881 numbered 20,373 and increased in ten years by 4,062 ; the Independents, which numbered 19,878 and increased by 1,687 ; the Lutherans (composed almost entirely of Germans or their descendants), which numbered 11,149 and increased by 590 ; the Bible Christians—formerly classed with Wesleyans, but at their own request kept separate from that body in the returns of the Census under review—which numbered 6,660 and increased by 2,466 ; the Disciples of Christ—styling themselves also Members of the Church of Christ or simply Christians—which numbered 4,859 and increased by 1,319 ; the Unitarians, which numbered 942 and decreased by 74 ; the Calvinists—originally a Welsh sect, also called Calvinistic Methodists, but more closely resembling Presbyterians—which numbered 712 and decreased by 720, or more than half ; the Christian Brethren—also called Plymouth Brethren or simply Brethren—which numbered 648 and increased by 455 ; the Society of Friends—also called Quakers—which numbered 282 and decreased by 51 ; and the Moravians or United Brethren, which numbered 172 and increased by 79. Besides these there were a number of minor Protestant sects with a few adherents to each, the Calvinistic Reform Church with 11, the Free Church of Victoria, with 24 (all

Then there were 4 Sandemanians, 3 Morrisonians, 3 Reformed Protestants, 100 Evangelists, 7 Evangelical Reformers, 4 members of the Evangelical Union, 7 Second Adventists, 1 Huguenot, and 1 Sankeyite. Thirty-six persons were returned as Dissenters, 42 as Nonconformists, 2 as of the Gospel Hall, 5 of the Christian Meeting House, 4 of the Town Mission, and 4 of the Mission School.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">181.</h3>
				<p>Of those classed as Roman Catholics, 6,323 were returned as Catholics, without any qualification. These increased in ten years by 3,171, whilst those returned as Roman Catholics increased by 29,689, the whole increase being 32,860. The Greek Catholics, which numbered 103 as against 332 in 1871, are not classed with the Roman Catholics.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">182.</h3>
				<p>Of the sects not classed either as Protestant or Catholic, the following were probably Christian :—The Catholic Apostolic Church with 383 adherents, the Apostolic Church with 5, the Israelites—also called Christian Israelites—with 238, the New or Swedenborgian Church with 292, the Mormons or Latter Day Saints with 15, the Christadelphians with 155, the Church of the Holy Disciples with 2, the Church of the First Born with 9, and the followers of Bishop Colenso with 1. The following were distinctly non-Christian :—The Jews, which numbered 4,330 and increased since 1871 by 759 ; the Chinese sects ; Confucians, Buddhists, Taou, &amp;c., all combined in the returns under the name of Pagans, which numbered 11,159 and decreased by 6,491 ; the Mahometans, which numbered 111, the Hindoos, which numbered 21, the Parsees and the Worshippers of the Sun, each of which numbered 1. But little is known of the tenets of the following sects, or whether they profess to follow any form of Christianity :—The Spiritualists or Spiritists, which numbered 853 and increased by 682 ; the Universalists with 68 adherents, the Theists with 14, the Memmonites with 2, the Josephites with 8, the Borrowites, Millerites, and Walkerites each with 1, the Church of God with 4, the Church of Eli Sands with 5, the Broad Church with 2, the Orthodox Church with 8, the Separatists with 5, the Primitives with 2, the Mosaic Dispensation with 2, the Original Session with 6, and the Brotherhood of New Life with 1.

				<p>The Census clerks were specially cautioned not to classify any one as of no religion, unless that term or some other which might fairly be held to express the same meaning was used respecting him. The numbers so placed were 2,607, as against 2,150 in 1871. Of these, 2,428 were returned as of No Religion, 17 of No Profession, and the remainder as follow :—53 Agnostics, 37 Atheists, 7 Secularists, 1 Positivist, 6 Socialists, 24 Materialists, 1 Immaterialist, 1 Iconoclast, 1 Fatalist, 2 Students of Philosophy, 1 Heretic, 1 Sceptic, 14 Infidels, and 4 Unbelievers. In 4 instances "Cosmopolitan," in 3 instances "£ s. d.," in 1 instance "Nature," and in 1 instance "Free Trade" was entered upon the schedule.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">185.</h3>
				<p>The persons returned as of no denomination and no religion amounted together to 7,586, or 1 in 11 of the population. If to these be added the numbers of the Unitarians and Spiritualists, a total is arrived at of 9,381, or 1 in 90 of the population, who have not hesitated to return themselves amongst those who are sometimes spoken of as unorthodox.<div class="footnote">
						<p>The two sects named are so set down by the Reverend Maurice Davies, D.D., in his<span class="emphasis">Unorthodox London,</span>pp. 31 and 302 ; and in his<span class="emphasis">Heterodox London,</span>pp. 1, 121, and 311. Tinsley Brothers, London, 1874.</p>
					</div>It is not to be supposed, however, that these figures represent the complete number. Those who have inwardly abandoned the beliefs in which they were brought up would probably, in many instances, shrink from stating as much in the Census schedule, but would prefer to shelter themselves in the ranks of the various sects, or avail themselves of the provision which allows them to object to make any entry whatever respecting their religious opinions, and thus the total amount of scepticism existing in Victoria cannot be expressed statistically.

						<p>An interesting letter on the religious belief of the Chinese, addressed to the Government Statist by Mr. C. P. Hodges, the well-known Chinese scholar, is published immediately after this Report.</p>
					</div>Of the remainder, 375 were returned as members of the Church of England, 81 as Presbyterians, 229 as Methodists, 5 as Baptists, 6 as Bible Christians, 1 as a Disciple of Christ, 132 as Roman Catholics, 4 as Mahometans, and 156 as objecting to state their religion. As no Chinese had made such an objection at any former Census, I directed the interpreters to make some inquiry into the matter, when it was explained that the majority of the objectors had ceased to have any faith in the peculiar tenets of the various sects grouped under the head of Paganism, and a few had secretly embraced Christianity, but they refrained from expressing this in the schedule for fear of arousing the animosity of their fellow-countrymen, and being subjected to persecution at their hands. Of the Chinese half-castes, numbering 366, 31 were amongst those who objected to state their belief, 21 were returned as Pagans, and the remainder were distributed amongst the Christian sects.

Of the remainder, 44 were set down as "Unsectarian," and 314 as of no religion. Upon inquiry of the superintendents of the Aboriginal stations as to the precise meaning of the last two terms, it was explained that the first was used to indicate those who had received religious instruction and had apparently been more or less impressed thereby, but had not embraced Christianity ; and the second, those who had not received any religious instruction, also those upon whom such instruction having been given had produced no visible effect.

				<p>The proportions in the table are those of the Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Jews to the sum of the three bodies combined ; and it should be pointed out that such proportions would all be somewhat lower if calculated to the whole population of specified beliefs, which, in addition to the bodies named, contains Pagans and other non-Christian sects, as well as persons of No Denomination, No Religion, &amp;c. In proportion to the total of the three combined bodies, Protestants were most numerous in New Zealand, and next to that in South Australia, those being the only colonies in which they amounted to more than 75 per cent. of the whole ; Roman Catholics were most numerous in Western Australia, next so in New South Wales and Queensland, those being the colonies in which they exceeded 25 per cent. of the whole, and Jews were most numerous in Victoria, that being the only colony in which they amounted to over ½ per cent. of the whole.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">193.</h3>
				<p>Entries of the ages of 449,744 males and 408,804 females appeared upon the Census schedules. On the other hand, no statement was made of the ages of 471 male and 347 female children, or of 1,868 male and 1,112 female adults. The unspecified have since been distributed amongst those whose ages were recorded, according to the same proportions the latter are found in, so that the probable ages of the whole population are shown.
						<span class="annotation"> [Ages.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">194.</h3>
				<p>It is to be regretted that a considerable want of accuracy occurs in making the return of ages not only here but elsewhere, and, from whatever motive, a tendency is observed, in almost every country where a Census is taken, to date back the age to the preceding decennial or quinquennial period.<div class="footnote">
						<p>Thus a person aged 26, 27, 28, or 29 is commonly set down as aged 25. A person aged 31, 32, 33, or 34, is set down as aged 30, &amp;c. Mr. E. C. Nowell, the Government Statistician of Tasmania, in his General Report upon the Census of that colony, 1881, page xx, makes the following appropriate and eloquent remarks upon this subject.—"Many persons either cannot or will not state their exact ages, and put them down roughly at the nearest decennial or quinquennial period. Hence they cluster like a swarm of bees round those periods. Some people, no doubt, really do not know their own ages, but many more fail to return them accurately simply from carelessness or want of conscientiousness. Until we have a higher standard of morality—until men learn to carry their religion into the smallest affairs of common life ; to acknowledge that the obligation to be scrupulous in complying with the laws of the land is as great as, if not greater, than to hold orthodox opinions on controverted subjects ; and to shrink as much from putting their hands to an untruth on a census schedule as from swearing what they know to be a lie in a court of justice ; until they are educated to observe truth and honor in the smallest as well as in the greatest matters ; and until they are brought to see that it is for the interest personally, as well as generally, of every member of a community to make its statistics as perfect as possible—until all this is recognised and carried into practice, such anomalies as these will occur in spite of every effort we may make to prevent them."</p>
					</div>For this reason, when an attempt is made to tabulate the population at each year of age, clusters are found to exist at such periods, and thus errors are indicated upon the very face of the table. It is, therefore, found more correct to arrange the ages in quinquennial periods, and afterwards distribute them into single years by proportion.</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_58"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">195.</h3>
				<p>The increase or diminution in the numbers of the population at each age at one Census-period, as compared with the previous one, is easily shown by placing the numbers in parallel columns and taking the difference between them. This, however, only indicates whether there are more or fewer persons at each age at the later than at the earlier period, but does not show how the numbers would have stood if the same people had lived, and remained in the country, and consequently whether, between the two Census-periods, a loss occurred by emigration and deaths, or a gain by immigration and births. There having been an interval of 10 years between the Censuses of 1871 and 1881, it is evident that every person who lived would be 10 years older at the latter period than at the former. As, however, some must have died at each age, and none of those born between the Census-periods would be more than 10 years old in 1881, it follows that there would necessarily be a smaller number in 1881 than in 1871, at each period of life over 10, unless the places of those who died were supplied by immigrants. To show the gain by immigration, or loss by emigration, which occurred at each age, I have constructed a table in which the numbers in 1881 are placed side by side with those who were returned as 10 years younger in 1871, and the births between the Census-periods are placed beside the numbers under 10 in 1881. The difference between the numbers in the two columns is then taken, to show the increase or decrease at each age, and the figures thus obtained are collated with those representing the deaths which have occurred during the decenniad intervening between the censuses ; the sum of the two, if there has been an increase, or the difference if a decrease, will then indicate the gain by excess of arrivals over departures, or loss by the contrary, which has taken place at each age during the 10 years. The following is the table in which this is shown, males and females being distinguished :—

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">196.</h3>
				<p>The sum of the numbers returned in 1871, and of the births which took place between then and the Census of 1881, expresses the whole number of persons to be accounted for, viz., 538,358 males and 462,041 females. A glance at the fifth column will show that the only periods at which the immigration was so great as to outnumber not only the deaths but also the emigration, were 25 to 30 (15 to 20 in 1871) in the males, and 20 to 25 (10 to 15 in 1871) in the females ; the excess of the former being 1,218 and of the latter 751. The sixth column shows the deaths at each period in the ten years, the difference between which and the numbers in the fifth column, where the minus sign occurs, or their sum where the plus sign occurs, gives the numbers in the last column, which express the actual gain by excess of arrivals over departures, or loss by excess of departures over arrivals at each period of age during the ten years.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">197.</h3>
				<p>It will be observed that, in the case of both males and females, a gain is shown in the period "Under 10" (not born in 1871), but this can scarcely have been caused by more infants being brought here than have been taken away, as the opposite has generally been noticed so far as the arrivals and departures by sea are concerned ; it is therefore probable that this apparent excess has resulted entirely from unregistered births. There has, however, undoubtedly been a net gain by immigration of 3,318 males at 25 to 35 (15 to 25 in 1871), and of 795 at 70 and</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_60"></div>
			<p>upwards (60 and upwards in 1871) ; also a net gain of 3,244 females at 15 to 30 (5 to 20 in 1871), and of 883 females at 60 and upwards (50 and upwards in 1871), a loss being shown at all the other periods.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">198.</h3>
				<p>The difference between the sum of the plus quantities and the sum of the minus quantities in the last column shows a net loss by emigration of 15,890 males, and a net gain by immigration of 805 females, which numbers agree exactly with those quoted in a previous paragraph,<div class="footnote">
						<p>See paragraph 58<span class="emphasis">ante.</span></p>
					</div>as showing the extent to which the natural increase of population had been diminished by emigration in the case of the males, and added to by immigration in the case of the females.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">199.</h3>
				<p>In 1871, a smaller number of males were returned at all the years of age from 20 to 35, and a smaller number of females at 24, and at each year from 26 to 28, than in 1861, but larger numbers at all the other years up to 90. In 1881 there were smaller numbers than in 1871 at various periods of life, which, together with the larger numbers that appeared at other periods, are shown in the following table :—

				<p>The term "infant," although applied in its legal sense to all persons under 21 years of age, in its popular sense is applied only to those who have not yet completed their first year. The following are terms of like common application which to many would convey more meaning than a mere statement of the age in figures :—"Children," to denote persons of from 1 to 5 years of age ; "boys and girls," from 5 to 15 years ; "youths and maidens," from 15 to 20 years ; "young men and young women," from 20 to 30 years ; "middle-aged men and middle-aged women," from 30 to 50 years ; "old men and old women," 50 years and upwards.

				<p>It is evident that a population which, relatively to the total number of units of which it is composed, contains a great many children and very old people, is not so physically effective as one which has a larger proportion of persons at the middle period of life. Speaking generally, it may be said that persons between 15 and 65 years of age are able to contribute largely to their own maintenance, and often to

Upon this principle the Victorian population was relatively somewhat stronger in 1881 than in 1871, although it was not at either period nearly so strong as in 1861 ; this will be seen by the following figures, which show the numbers in every 10,000 living at the supporting and dependent ages at the three periods :—</p>

It had not, however, reached so high by 587 per 10,000 as the proportion in 1861, that being a period at which, although the stream of immigration which had been attracted to Victoria by the fame of the gold-fields had ceased, its expanding influence

				<p>It will be observed that, notwithstanding the smaller total population of New South Wales, she returned more males than Victoria at each of the periods between 25 and 40. Males at all the other age periods, however, and females at all the age periods, were more numerous in this colony than in New South Wales.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">222.</h3>
				<p>Almost all the Chinese males living in Victoria are adults, as many as 11,516, out of 11,869, being over 21 years of age ; most of these were in the prime of life, no less than 8,924 being between 35 and 60 years. Of the 259 Chinese females, the majority were children, only 46 being over 21 years of age. It is probable that most of the young Chinese of both sexes were half-castes, although not always noted as such. Twenty-five of the Chinese males were set down as being between 75 and 80 years, 7 as being between 80 and 85 years, and 1 as being 85 years of age.

				<p>According to the returns of the Aborigines, children under 5 amounted to 12 per cent. of the whole, the same proportion in the general population being 13 per cent. ; persons under 15 amounted to 34 per cent., and persons under 21 to 43 per cent. of the whole, as against 38 per cent. and 52 per cent. at the same periods of life in the general population. Four of the male and 1 of the female Aborigines were set down as being between 75 and 80, 1 of the males as being between 80 and 85, and 1 of the males as being 90 years of age.

			<h1 class="section-title">EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">224.</h3>
				<p>The Census return of education embraces the result of an inquiry as to the ability of each member of the population to read and write, but does not extend to any higher attainments, except in the case of individuals possessing University degrees, respecting whom the sub-enumerators were instructed to enter the letters by which the degree was expressed, and the name of the University at which it was obtained. An account of the holders of University degrees will be given later. The present portion of this Report, therefore, treats only of the extent to which the inhabitants of the colony were versed in the rudimentary arts of reading and writing.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">225.</h3>
				<p>Probably most of the Chinese acquire some proficiency in reading and writing their own language, but as the characters in it number, it is said, at least 40,000 (words not being built up of letters as in our own system, but each character standing for a word), and as the ability to decipher and form a few of these characters is probably attained by almost every Chinese during the course of his lifetime, whereas a perfect knowledge of every character in the language is rarely, if ever, gained even by the most

			<p>advanced scholars, it is difficult to say where the ability of a Chinaman to read and write begins and where it ends—how many characters it is necessary for him to know and be able to make before he could be stated to be instructed, or how few would warrant his being classed as illiterate. This being the case, and considering also that a knowledge of a certain number of the characters of their own language would but slightly, if at all, add to their usefulness as citizens of this community, I was instrumental in causing a short instruction to be inserted at the head of the Education Column of the Householder's Schedule used at the Census of 1871, to the effect that the Chinese not able to read or write English should be set down as illiterate. This was noticed with approval in the other Australasian colonies, and on the occasion of the present Census a similar instruction was embodied in the schedule of almost every colony of the group. As, however, such a number of illiterate adults would give a false view of the educational state of the community, I have had tables prepared excluding them as well as the Aborigines from the numbers, and shall, in the present portion of my Report, treat of the population exclusive of the members of those two races.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">226.</h3>
				<p>The returns of education were not so complete as those given in response to most of the other Census inquiries, the schedules being silent as to the degree of education possessed by as many as 8,119 males and 6,468 females over five years of age. These have, however, been distributed by proportion amongst the other numbers, and thus, after eliminating the Chinese and Aborigines, I am able to treat of the whole residue of the population.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">227.</h3>
				<p>The persons able to read numbered 700,193, of whom 650,809 could also write, and those unable to read numbered 149,245. The population treated of being 849,438, it follows that 82 per cent. of that number could read, 77 per cent. could write, and 18 per cent. were unable to read.
						<span class="annotation"> [Education at all ages.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">228.</h3>
				<p>These figures apply to the population at all ages ; but it is evident that, to obtain a correct knowledge of the educational condition of the community, it is necessary to eliminate those who are not old enough to receive instruction. Taking then the population of 5 years of age and upwards, numbering 735,499, it is found that 696,025, or 95 per cent., could read ; 650,809, or 88 per cent., could write, and only 39,474, or 5 per cent., could not read.

				<p>The returns show rudimentary education to have been more widely spread in 1881 than at any previous period since the discovery of gold. This is made plain by the following figures, which indicate the measure of such education at successive Censuses.

				<p>It will be noticed that education retrograded somewhat, between 1857 and 1861, but an improvement took place between the last-named Census and that of 1871, and a still further and considerably greater improvement between 1871 and 1881.</p>

				<p>The returns of 1881 show the instruction of females to have been slightly inferior to that of males. In proportion to their respective numbers (viz., 382,053 males, and 353,446 females over 5 years of age), they were about equal in point of ability to read, but more males than females could write.

				<p>Every one of the denominations shows a satisfactory improvement from Census to Census, the advancement of all, during the 20 years ended with 1881 being most encouraging. Even the Roman Catholic children, which at the date of the Census under review were still less educated than those of the members of any other</p>

				<p>The school age prescribed by law differs in the various Australasian colonies.<div class="footnote">
						<p>The prescribed school age is in Victoria from 6 to 15 years, in New South Wales from 6 to 14 years, in Queensland from 6 to 12 years, in South Australia from 7 to 13 years, in Tasmania from 7 to 14 years, and in New Zealand from 7 to 13 years.</p>
					</div>In scarcely one of them, strange to say, have the Census returns been compiled in such a manner that the state of education at its own school age can be ascertained from the published tables, much less compared with that obtaining at the school age of this colony. All of the colonies, however, have published their education returns in quinquennial periods, so the period from 5 to 15 years will be adopted for Victoria, as well as for the others, as an age at which the success of the respective educational systems can be conveniently judged. The following figures measure the education of the children of each colony at that age, the colonies being arranged in order :—

				<p>It will be observed that Victoria stands easily at the head of the list, being much in advance of all the other colonies, both as regards reading and writing. As the arrangement is in accordance with the numbers able to read, South Australia is placed below New Zealand, and Tasmania below Western Australia ; but the order in these cases would have been reversed had the arrangement been in accordance with the numbers able to write, as the proportion of such was greater in South Australia than in New Zealand, and greater in Tasmania than in Western Australia.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">242.</h3>
				<p>In Victoria children were sometimes returned as able to read when 2 years and even 1 year old, and as able to write at almost equally early ages ; but, as the Census is, I conceive, not intended to record the acquirements of infant phenomena, in all probability exaggerated by parental fondness or vanity, I instructed the compiling clerks not to tabulate any child as able to read until it was 3 years, or as able

			<p>to write until it was 5 years of age. Between 3 and 6 years of age the number of male children returned was 34,101, and of female children 33,211, of whom the degree of education, as finally made up in the tables, was as follows :—</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">243.</h3>
				<p>Before they arrive at the school age, girls appear to be more capable of receiving instruction than boys, as the proportions of the former able to read and able to write were higher than those of the latter. Some doubt exists as to the reliability of the information given as to the acquirements of very young children ; but if it be true that over a fifth of the boys and nearly a fourth of the girls between 3 and 6 years of age could read, as is shown by the figures, it cannot be said that instruction, even at this early age, is entirely thrown away.</p>

				<p>Education amongst adults was more general in 1881 than in 1871. This is especially the case as regards female education, the improvement in which is very striking.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">246.</h3>
				<p>It will be observed that at both periods the amount of education respecting which the Census supplies information, was rather more general amongst male than female adults. This is especially the case as regards writing, although the difference between the sexes in this respect was not so marked in 1881 as in 1871.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">247.</h3>
				<p>In compiling their returns of education, most of the colonies of this group have excluded the Aborigines, but several of them have not separated the Chinese, or distinguished their educational attainments so as to admit of their being accurately deducted from the remainder of the population ; and as the Chinese have been set down as illiterate if not able to read English, which few of them are able to do, the view which such colonies have given of the state of adult education within their borders is not so favorable as it should have been. To rectify this, and to enable fair comparisons to be made between the different colonies, I have in these cases assumed the bulk of the Chinese to be included amongst the adults unable to read, and have deducted them therefrom, so that the state of adult education in all the colonies is given, as nearly as possible, exclusive of Chinese and Aborigines. Upon the numbers so obtained, the following proportions have been based :—

				<p>A comparison of these figures with those in a former table will show that males and females of 15 and upwards were more generally educated than those of 21 and upwards, thereby proving that the standard of education in the former was raised by the nearer approach to universal education existing amongst those between 15 and 21.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">251.</h3>
				<p>Education amongst males of 21 and upwards was more common than amongst females at the same period of life, which is more especially apparent in the matter of writing.

				<p>The authorities of the different religious bodies were found to vary greatly in regard to the number of scholars they deem it expedient to entrust to each instructor. Thus, whilst in the Church of England schools the average was 11 scholars to each teacher, in the Roman Catholic schools it was as high as 30 to each, or exactly the same as in the State schools. The following are the</p>

				<p>It is right I should point out that the name of the denomination with which the private schools were stated to be connected is believed to have been sometimes meant to imply merely the religion of the head teacher or proprietor of the school, and perhaps the principles on which the establishment was conducted ; not that it was recognised as attached to his church or was subordinate to its clergy. The exceptions to this are believed to be most of the schools returned as Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Jewish, a few of those returned as of the Church of England, and one or two of those returned as Presbyterian and Wesleyan, but probably none of those returned as connected with any other denomination.</p>

				<p>The numbers of children below, at, and above the school age, who attended school on the 4th April, may be compared with the numbers at the same periods of life in the general population, the scholars under the school age being assumed to be between 3 and 6 years, and those above the school age being assumed to be between 15 and 18 years. As a fair proportion of the few young Chinese (mostly half-castes) and young Aborigines in the colony would probably be at school, the individuals of these races need not in this instance be eliminated. The following are the numbers of children in the population and at school at the three periods of age referred to ; also the proportions of the latter to the former :—

				<p>The figures given show the actual school attendance on Monday the 4th April, or the day succeeding the Census Sunday. As, however, it was thought only natural that the teachers would endeavour to secure as full an attendance of scholars as possible on that day, which might give larger numbers than were in the habit of attending under ordinary circumstances, it was deemed expedient also to obtain a statement of the average attendance during the five school days of the week preceding the Census ; and, as this was not generally known beforehand, it is believed that the numbers so obtained afford a fair view of the ordinary school attendance. These numbers in the following table are placed side by side with those showing the actual attendance on the Monday after the Census :—

				<p>It will be observed that the average number of scholars attending during the week preceding the Census was less by 13,000 than the number attending on the day after it. The excess of the numbers at the latter period was almost entirely amongst the State schools and the Roman Catholic schools, in the former of which the attendance.</p>

			<p>was nearly 10 per cent. and in the latter nearly 11 per cent. greater on the 4th April than the five days' average. In other cases there was no evidence of any special effort having been made to collect the scholars on the Monday, the difference between the numbers at the two periods being in all cases trifling, and the figures for the five days being in most instances slightly in excess of those for the 4th April.</p>

				<p>The children mentioned were no doubt all actually at school, but they evidently do not represent all the children receiving education in the colony ; for some children, attached to and on the books of both State and private schools, must necessarily have been absent during the week preceding and on the day following the Census, and some were doubtless receiving instruction at home under tutors or governesses. The number of children set down as scholars in the occupation column of the Census schedule may be supposed to afford means of ascertaining the whole number of children being educated, the result being much in excess of the return of those attending school at either of the periods named, as will be seen by the following figures :—

				<p>According to this table, nearly 43 per cent. of the children between 3 and 6 years, or before they had reached the school age, nearly 77 per cent. of those between 6 and 15, or at the school age, and nearly 10 per cent. of those between 15 and 18, or after they had passed the school age, were receiving instruction about the time the Census was taken. The figures in the table on which these proportions were based probably give a fair statement of the numbers being educated at that time ; but it is known that many children are sent to school only during broken periods of the year, being removed at times to suit the convenience of parents, and again sent as they can be spared from home duties, and thus many more children than those whose numbers are given in the table were probably reached by the schoolmaster for a longer or shorter period during the course of the year. The Education Department have estimated that as many as 195,526 distinct children attended at State schools during some portion of 1881, of whom 156,206 were at the school age. These with the numbers at the same age, returned as attending private schools and being educated at home, give a total of 188,265, or 38,810 more than the numbers at the school age shown in the table ; the latter being the probable number of children at that age who, although attending school during some portion of 1881, were not so attending when the Census was taken.</p>

				<p>The Chinese under 20, including half-castes, numbered 494, viz., 286 boys and 208 girls. Of the former of these, 84, or 29 per cent., and of the latter 73, or 35 per cent., were returned as receiving education ; which, considering many of them must have been under and some over the school age, is not an unsatisfactory result. Of the whole number being educated—viz., 157—85 were attending State and 10 private schools, 18 were being instructed at home, and of 44 the mode of education was not stated.

The unspecified, however, have been distributed by proportion

				<p>Of the males at all ages from infancy upwards, 314,563 were set down as unmarried, 124,654 as husbands, and 12,866 as widowers. Of the females at all ages, 262,478 were set down as unmarried, 126,042 as wives, and 21,743 as widows.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">275.</h3>
				<p>The wives exceeded the husbands by 1,388, as against an excess of wives over husbands, amounting to only 133 in 1871, and an excess of husbands over wives, amounting to 4,290 in 1861.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">277.</h3>
				<p>Although, throughout the colony the number of husbands was nearly equal to that of wives, it does not follow that the husbands all belonged to the wives, or all the wives to the husbands. Of the 124,654 husbands and 126,042 wives returned, only 112,539 abode in the same house on the Census night ; thus the husbands whose wives were absent numbered 12,115, and the wives whose husbands were absent numbered 13,503. The difference between the detached husbands and detached wives was of course the same as that between the whole number of husbands and the whole number of wives, viz., 1,388, as already stated.</p>

				<p>The proportion of husbands whose wives were absent was smaller, but the proportion of wives whose husbands were absent was somewhat larger on the Census night of 1881 than on that of 1871 or 1861.

In every 1,000 married women returned in 1881, 892 were with, and 108 apart from their husbands ; the corresponding numbers in 1871 being 897 and 103, and in 1861, 895 and 105.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">279.</h3>
				<p>In 1881, of every 1,000 of the population of the colony, 291 were in the marriage state ; of every 1,000 males, 276 were husbands, of every 1,000 females, 307 were wives.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">280.</h3>
				<p>At 20 years of age and upwards the number of husbands was about equal to that of wives, there being 124,599 of the former and 124,569 of the latter. There were, however, at this period of life 41,290 more men than women, and thus it happens that whilst of every 1,000 of the men, only 529 were husbands ; of every 1,000 of the women, as many as 641 were wives.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">281.</h3>

				<p>Husbands under 21 years of age were in the proportion of 23 to every 10,000 husbands of all ages, or about 1 in 440. Wives under 21 years of age were in the proportion of 238 to every 10,000 wives of all ages, or about 1 in 42.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">285.</h3>

				<p>The figures just given furnish a proportion of 112 spinsters to every 100 bachelors ; but to ascertain the full marrying power of the population, it is evidently necessary to add the widowers to the bachelors, and the widows to the spinsters, when the proportion of marriageable women will be found to be nearly 120 to every 100 marriageable men.

				<p>It will be observed that each Census, as compared with the previous one, showed an increase in the number of marriageable women, but not so of marriageable men, whose number was much largest in 1861. The subsequent Census, that of 1871, showed a falling-off of 17,019 ; but the next, that under review, showed an increase of 9,946, which, however, still left the number of marriageable men fewer by 7,073 than in 1861.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">309.</h3>
				<p>The returns for 1881 show a smaller number of marriageable males than marriageable females at each of the quinquennial periods of age at which they jointly occur. The reason of the whole number of the former being greater than that of the latter is that, in consequence of the ages at which marriages are found to take place, the marriageable age of females is assumed to commence at an earlier period of life (15 years) than that of males (20 years), which gives an addition of 49,677 to the former. Were 20 to be assumed to be the commencement of the marriageable age of females, as it is of males, the marriageable females would number only 69,701, or 30,166 less than the marriageable males.</p>

Thus men have a greater tendency to marry is prosperous than in dull times, and the men of a rural; and especially of an agricultural community, have a greater tendency to marry than those of an urban one. To demonstrate this I have constructed the following table, which shows the proportion of marriages to the population, to the number of single men, and to the number of single women in each of the last five Census years :—

				<p>The numbers in the last column but two, and those in the last column, show such a falling-off that, if the proportion that marriages bear to the total population or to the number of single females, were to be accepted as an index of the prosperity of the community, an alarming amount of depression would be indicated at the last two periods. The figures in the last column but one, however (hereafter called the "marriage rate"), tell a very different tale, and exhibit just such fluctuations as might have been expected from the changes which took place in the circumstances of the population between the different periods. Thus, in 1854, there was a very large influx to the colony of single adult males, some of whom brought money with them, which they saw, or thought they saw, every prospect of speedily increasing, whilst others actually did make money very quickly, and consequently the "marriage rate" was high, but doubtless not so high as it would have been had it not been for the discomfort of living in tents, and other privations incident to a life on the early goldfields to which a large portion of the community was then subjected. By 1857 immigration had, for the time, been overdone, the result being that the gold obtained was very much less in proportion to the number of miners at work than it had been, whilst the discomforts of a goldfields life were as great as ever, and so the "marriage rate" naturally declined. By 1861 the yield of gold had seriously diminished, and as persons had not yet turned, to any great extent, to other pursuits, much distress was experienced, and the "marriage rate" fell to a minimum. By 1871, and in a greater degree by 1881, a large proportion of the population had settled on farms, whilst some, unable to obtain congenial occupation, had left the colony ; tents had almost disappeared from the goldfields ; the miners were, for the most part, working for wages, and did not, as formerly, rush about from place to place ; manufactures had been started, and had made considerable progress, and accordingly the "marriage rate" improved. In 1871 it was higher than at any previous period of the colony's history, and in 1881 it was still higher than in 1871.</p>

				<p>According to a rule which, at my suggestion, was introduced at the Census of 1871, and which has since been adopted throughout the Australasian colonies, instructions were given to the sub-enumerators to enter all Chinamen as unmarried except those who had at the time of the Census or had had at some previous period wives in Australasia. Following out this principle, 11,102 male Chinese of 14 years old and upwards, or 95 per cent. of the whole, were set down as single, 560 were set down as husbands, and 30 as widowers. Married Chinamen were therefore in the proportion to the whole number over 14 as 1 to 21, and married and widowed together as 1 to 20. Of the 86 female Chinese over 14 years of age, 36, or 42 per cent., were wives, 36 were spinsters, and 1 was a widow.

The colony which stood highest in this respect was Queensland, where nearly 1 in 10 of the single women married in the year, or about twice the proportion obtaining in Victoria :—</p>

				<p>To ascertain the relative fruitfulness of women in different countries it is necessary to compare the number of married women at the reproductive ages with the legitimate births. This can be done in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and New Zealand, but not in the other Australasian colonies ; as in the returns of the latter, no distinction is made between the infants born in, and those born out of wedlock. By means of such a comparison in regard to the four colonies named, it would appear that the highest degree of fecundity exists in New South Wales, and the lowest in Victoria, this being probably owing to the fact that the married women are,

				<p>The number of single women living in concubinage is ascertained approximately, by making a calculation based upon the assumption that the illegitimate births bear the same proportion to the single women at reproductive ages that the legitimate births do to the married women at such ages. This gives a number which does not include public prostitutes, who, as they very rarely have children, are excluded from the computation. By comparing the number of women so found, with the total number of single women at childbearing ages, the proportion of the latter living irregularly may also be ascertained. A calculation founded upon this principle shows that concubinage is most rife in Queensland, next in New South Wales, and next in Victoria and New Zealand, there being only a fractional difference between these two colonies. In the following table, the colony in which the largest proportion of concubinage exists is placed first, and that in which the smallest proportion exists, last :—

			<h1 class="section-title">OCCUPATIONS OF THE PEOPLE.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">326.</h3>
				<p>The occupations of the people have been tabulated upon a form similar to that used in 1871, this having been adapted by me at that time from the form of classification originally devised by the late Dr. Farr, C.B., F.R.S., for use in the United Kingdom, such changes alone being introduced as were required to render it suitable to the circumstances of the colony.
						<span class="annotation"> [Occupations.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">327.</h3>
				<p>The farmer of this mode of classification formed the groups and combinations as far as possible according to<span class="emphasis">the materials on which people worked</span>, and this being kept in mind, a ready explanation is found of the reason of some of the groupings, the principle of which it might otherwise be difficult to understand.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">328.</h3>
				<p>On the present occasion the Victorian form for tabulating this portion of the Census has been followed in all the Australasian colonies except New South Wales. Close comparisons of the occupation returns of all the colonies with this exception are thus rendered easy, and the form being, as I have stated, based upon that used in the United Kingdom, comparisons can also be made without difficulty between the returns of the concordant colonies and those of the mother country.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">329.</h3>
				<p>It is to be regretted that, in this respect, New South Wales should have chosen to stand apart from her neighbours. The inquiry as to occupations is generally considered to be the most important made at the Census, and any difference in the mode of treating the returns from that based upon recognized and generally adopted methods, must render the result less valuable not only to the diverging colony but to every other in the group, and indirectly and with less force to other and more distant countries.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">330.</h3>
				<p>An instruction was printed on the householder's schedule to the effect that if a person followed two or more occupations he was to enter them in the order of their importance to himself, and this has been borne in mind in tabulating the returns, the first named being the only occupation of which account has been taken, subsequent ones being necessarily ignored, as no person can be tabulated more than once under any head of inquiry. The sole exception to this rule is in the case of Government officers following some other calling ; as for instance a deputy registrar or postmaster being also a storekeeper or a farmer, in which event he would be</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_95"></div>
			<p>tabulated as the latter, although he may have placed it second. The number of public officers of the different grades is always known, but the number of storekeepers and farmers can only be ascertained when a Census is taken.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">331.</h3>
				<p>The occupations of the people of this colony are grouped into 6 classes, which are subdivided into 15 orders, which are further subdivided into 62 sub-orders. Under the sub-orders 380 distinct callings are shown, some of which are still further subdivided, the result being that, in all, the names of over 1,600 occupations, and the numbers of either sex following each occupation, appear in the tables.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">332.</h3>
				<p>It would, no doubt, have been desirable that the ages of the persons following the different callings should have been shown in quinquennial or decennial periods, but the labour attending such a compilation, and the bulk to which the returns would have been swelled thereby, deterred me from attempting such a task ; the numbers under and over 20, however, of each occupation are shown, in this respect the practice being followed which was introduced at the Census of 1871.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">333.</h3>
				<p>All the classes and all the orders in which the occupations are grouped contain both males and females. One of the sub-orders, however, contains no male, viz., that relating to wives and widows engaged in domestic duties ; and four of them contain no female, viz., those embracing persons engaged in defence, connected with law, connected with arms, and connected with water. Of the 380 original callings, 221 were followed by both males and females, 144 were followed exclusively by males, and 15 exclusively by females. In all 365 of these callings were followed by males, and 236 by females.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">334.</h3>
				<p>Males over 20 numbered 235,619. This number is distributed amongst all the headings in which males are found except three, viz., Errand boys (Order 6, Sub-order 5), Milliners and Dressmakers (Order 9, Sub-order 2), and Inmates of Reformatories (Order 15, Sub-order 2). With the exception of 656 males over 20 returned as sons, relatives, or visitors ; 154 returned as students or scholars ; 1,221 returned as "gentlemen," "of independent means," &amp;c. ; 5,194 returned as supported by the community, including inmates of charitable institutions, paupers, prisoners, &amp;c. ; and the unspecified, who were probably for the most part unemployed, numbering 5,216, the balance, numbering 223,178, or about seventeen-eighteenths of the whole, were returned under the head of some business pursuit or calling.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">335.</h3>
				<p>The number of females over 20 was 194,329. These are distributed throughout 222 of the 236 headings under which females are found. Making deductions from these in the same manner as has been done in regard to the males, viz., wives and widows of no specified occupation, numbering 100,082 ; daughters, relatives, or visitors, numbering 15,669 ; scholars, numbering 78 ; those returned as "ladies," "of</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_96"></div>
			<p>Independent means," &amp;c., numbering 705 ; those supported by the community, numbering 2,585 ; and the unspecified, numbering 1,422 ; the residue, representing those following some trade or business, amounts to 73,788, or 38 per cent. of the whole.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">336.</h3>
				<p>Males under 20 find a place under 311 of the headings. The total number of males at this age was 216,464. Deducting from this number those returned as sons, relatives or visitors, numbering 73,168 ; those returned as students or scholars, numbering 91,979 ; those returned as "of independent means," numbering 18 ; those returned as supported by the community, numbering 1,087 ; and the unspecified, numbering 1,214 ; there remains a total of 48,998, or about 23 per cent. of the whole, who were earning, or attempting to earn, their livelihood in the pursuit of some recognized trade or occupation.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">337.</h3>
				<p>The number of females under 20 amounted to 215,934. Females at this age are found under 153 of the headings. Deducting wives and widows of no specified occupation, numbering 953 ; daughters, relatives or visitors, numbering 90,429 ; scholars numbering 92,444 ; those returned as "of independent means," numbering 35 ; those supported by the community, numbering 1,035 ; and the unspecified, numbering 60 ; the remainder is 30,978, or rather more than 14 per cent. of the total, representing those engaged in some description of business occupation.</p>

				<p>The first class may be defined as consisting of persons engaged in the government and defence of the country, and in satisfying the intellectual, moral, and educational wants of its inhabitants. In 1871 it contained 14,131 and in 1881 18,444 persons, the increase during the interval being 4,313, or 31 per cent. At the former period it contained rather less than 2 per cent., and at the latter period rather more than 2 per cent. of the population of the colony.

				<p>It will be observed that only 3 Ministers of the Crown are accounted for in the returns of 1871, and 4 in those of 1881 ; and only 15 Members of Parliament are accounted for at the former, and 8 at the latter period. The reason of these numbers being so small is, that when the ordinary as well as the official occupation is given, the former is always taken in preference to the latter. The number of Ministers and of Members of the Legislature is known irrespective of the Census, but the whole number of those who follow the professions or trades to which such Ministers or Members belong can only be ascertained when a Census is taken.</p>

The reason of the numbers in 1881 being smaller than in 1871 probably is, that more at the latter period than at the former returned themselves indefinitely as "Civil servant," "Government officer," &amp;c., without stating the office held.

				<p>The inmates of charitable institutions increased from 5,869 in 1871 to 7,366 in 1881, or by 26 per cent. A considerable falling off is shown in the inmates of industrial schools, which is attributable to the operation of the boarding-out system which had not been introduced in 1871. Thirty-one beggars were returned in 1871, but only 14 in 1881, the latter being in the proportion of 1 to every 61,000 of the population.

				<p>Between the Censuses of 1851 and 1854 the gold discoveries had taken place, and it was felt that a mode of classifying the occupations which placed those of more than half the inhabitants of the colony under the head of "Residue" was insufficient to meet the requirements of the increased population. Therefore, a new system was devised by Mr. F. A. Corbett, the officer who had charge of the Censuses of 1854, 1857, and 1861, which, although less comprehensive than that adopted in 1871 and 1881, particulars of which have already been given at length, is an accurate and scientific method, and, so far as it goes, accords closely with the English system. The following condensation of this mode of classifying the occupations brought on to the latest Census may prove useful for purposes of comparison.

				<p>In tabulating the Census returns the rule adopted was to place persons under the heads of industry they usually followed, although they might, at the time the Census was taken, be out of employment ; the only exception being in the case of inmates of charitable and penal institutions, who, in the first instance, were classed as "patients," "prisoners," &amp;c.

				<p>It will be observed that of traders, workers and dealers in textile fabrics, dress and fibrous materials, and workers and dealers in food and drinks, Victoria had a larger proportion than any of the other colonies ; that of persons engaged in the learned professions, literature, science, and art, the proportion in Victoria was identical with that in Western Australia, and above that in any of the other colonies ; but that of persons engaged in government and defence the proportion in Victoria was smaller than that in any of the other colonies.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">465.</h3>
				<p>In consequence of the peculiar manner in which the occupations in New South Wales are classified, I have found it impossible to make any regular comparison between them and the occupations pursued in the other colonies. The treatment of the subject in the mother colony is meager in the extreme, and the mode of grouping such as might perhaps have answered sufficiently well 40 or 50 years since, but is quite out of date at the present time. The survival of the old system is apparent in the fact that agricultural and pastoral pursuits, which were the only occupations of any great importance in the early days of Australian settlement, are given in considerable detail, whilst no provision is made for showing the numbers engaged on railways, in carrying otherwise than on railways or in coaching, or in telegraph service, and what is of still more importance, especially for the purpose of making comparisons with Victoria, no attempt is made to show the numbers engaged in manufacturing pursuits. The groupings are but few, as compared with those in the other colonies, and the descriptions are so indefinite that it is impossible to know what occupations.

			<p>the respective groups contain. Incomplete, however, as the descriptions are, incongruities appear upon the face of them, which leave room for the supposition that others exist which do not meet the eye. The following are specimens of some of the anomalies referred to :—One combination contains, with other occupations, such incongruous callings as printers and watchmakers ; another, bookbinders, barbers, and upholsterers ; another, shipbuilders and wheelwrights ; another, cutlers and farriers ; nothing being stated as to how many each group contains of these, or of the followers of other trades named in the description, or of those not so named, covered by the sign "&amp;c.," with which most of the descriptions are followed. Moreover, there is a group headed "Miscellaneous Occupations," containing 19,780 persons, of the callings pursued by whom no explanation whatever is given. The following are a few of the groups which it appears probable, although not certain, are comparable with those of Victoria, and in which, therefore, the numbers and proportions in the two colonies are shown :—</p>

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_142"></div>
			<p>already stated, there is some doubt, the comparison being only given for what it may be worth, there were, when the Census was taken, more Government officers, more persons employed in defence, more servants, more merchants and shopkeepers, more officers and sailors of the mercantile marine, and more persons engaged in pastoral pursuits in New South Wales than in Victoria. The number of wives and widows engaged in domestic duties, and of young children, was higher in Victoria than in New South Wales ; the proportion of such persons to the total population was, however, about the same in the two colonies.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">467.</h3>
				<p>It will be noticed that the persons of unstated occupations were nearly twice as numerous in New South Wales as in Victoria, which has arisen from the fact that, in the former, the occupations of persons out of work were not distinguished in the returns, whereas in this colony the unemployed were classified under their proper occupations in the general tables, after which they were separated, and their respective callings were given in another table.<div class="footnote">

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">468.</h3>
				<p>It will be observed that according to the Census returns there were nearly twice as many males and more than seven times as many females out of work in New South Wales as in Victoria. In the former colony the unemployed were in the proportion of 1 in every 76 of the population, whereas in this colony they were only in the proportion of 1 in every 191.</p>

				<p>In compiling the returns of a census, it is obviously necessary that the numbers entered under the different heads of inquiry should be arranged in groups ; but the work cannot be said to be done properly unless the component parts of those groups are also shown, so that persons desiring fuller information than is conveyed by the group headings may be able to obtain it, and that those who disagree with the mode of classification adopted may have it in their power to rearrange the numbers according to some other method. This principle has been kept in view and adhered to in compiling the Victorian Census, and in no part more completely than that relating to the occupations of the people. In connexion therewith the following list has been prepared, in which the distinct calling of each individual

The two combined, representing those entirely disabled for the time being, but not as a rule permanently affected, were thus in the proportion of 169 to every 10,000 living, or 1 in 59.

				<p>All the Australasian colonies except New South Wales have published returns of sickness and accidents, those for New Zealand, however, applying only to persons over 15 years of age, and therefore not comparable with the others. Omitting the two colonies named, Queensland shows the smallest proportion of persons laid up from these causes and South Australia and Tasmania the largest, next to which comes Victoria. The following are the proportions, the colonies being arranged in order, the one with the lowest ratio of disablement being placed first, and that with the highest last :—

				<p>New Zealand, as has been just stated, returned those disabled persons only who were over 15 years of age. These were in the very low proportion of 1 in 89 of the population at the same period of life. A proportion calculated upon the Victorian returns at a similar age gives 1 disabled person in 42.</p>

				<p>The loss suffered by the community in consequence of physical disablement is probably realized by few. Taking the sick and those suffering from accidents together, there were in Victoria, on the Census day, 14,567 persons—viz., 8,543 males and 6,024 females—in a disabled condition ; which means that the children were obliged to discontinue their studies, the men their work or business, and the women their household or other duties for that day on account of illness or bodily injury. Supposing the Census day to have been an average one as regards the amount of infirmity prevailing, which there is no reason to believe it was not, there would obviously in one year be an amount of work lost from this cause equal to that of 1 person for 14,567 years, or of 1 male for 8,543 years, and of 1 female for 6,024 years. Or putting it in other words, there would, if Sundays be included, be 5,316,955 days' work lost on account of illness in the year, viz., 3,118,195 by males, and 2,198,760 by females ; or, if Sundays be not included, there would be 4,559,471 days'

			<p>work lost, viz., 2,673,959 by males and 1,885,512 by females. This is altogether irrespective of the loss occasioned by illnesses of a slight or partial character, not serious enough to cause work to be altogether discontinued, which according to instructions would not be returned, or of the loss to others occasioned by attendance on sick persons, or by reason of deafmuteism, blindness, lunacy, &amp;c.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">476.</h3>
				<p>According to the figures, the average number of days' disabling infirmity in the course of one year experienced by each person in the community is 6.2, or 6.9 days by each male, and 5.3 days by each female. If working days only be considered, each person on the average loses by this 5.3 such days, each male losing 5.9 such days, and each female 4.6 such days.</p>

				<p>It will be observed that the amount of sickness experienced by males increased at every period of age after 10 years, and that by females at every period of age, the increases at the later periods being very striking ; cases of accident also increased very steadily amongst males up to 75 years of age, and increased amongst females, although not quite so steadily, to the end of life. As the chance of meeting with an accident is not so great in old age as in middle age and youth,</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_158"></div>
			<p>it is probable that many of the accidents from which old people were reported to be. suffering were received by them at earlier periods of life, the effects being still felt in old age.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">479.</h3>
				<p>Members of Friendly Societies, noting the increased tendency to illness as age advances, will recognize the desirability of encouraging young men to join their ranks, and the absolute necessity, if they are to remain solvent, of accumulating funds before the members advance in life. The Census day being accepted as a normal one in point of the illness prevailing, the figures show that in this colony men between 20 and 25 years of age are liable to be laid up by reason of sickness or accident for about 3 working days in the year, men between 25 and 30 for 3<span class="media"></span>such days, and men between 30 and 35 for 4<span class="media"></span>formula such days ; whereas men between 55 and 60 would probably be laid up for 16 working days in the year, men between 60 and 65 for 21½ such days, and men between 65 and 70 for 32 such days.
						<span class="annotation"> [Friendly Societies.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">480.</h3>
				<p>In most Friendly Societies, 18 years of age is the youngest period at which members can be admitted, but in practice few join before 20. Assuming, as before, the Census day to have been a normal one in point of the prevalence of illness, the Census figures give an experience for males of 20 years of age and upwards of 9.3 days' disablement during the year. It seems to argue well for the effectiveness of the medical examination to which candidates for membership of these bodies are subjected, and of the supervision exercised over members claiming sick pay, that the last returns of Friendly Societies show that in 1881 the average amount of sickness for which payment was claimed in the year was only 7.8 working days per member, or 1½ days less than the average shown by the Census. It must, however, be borne in mind that the mean age of members of Friendly Societies is in all probability younger than that of the general population over 20 ; also, that as some members do not draw their sick allowance, the sickness for which payment is made is less than that actually experienced ; and, moreover, that members of Friendly Societies are, as a rule, above the average of the population in point of provident habits and regularity of conduct, and that the medical examination which, as has been stated, they are obliged to undergo prior to their being admitted, affords a guarantee that, at that time at any rate, they are also above the average in regard to soundness of health.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">481.</h3>
				<p>In proportion to their respective numbers more boys than girls were sick up to 10 years of age, but from 10 to 55 more females were sick than males. At every period of life, the proportion of males suffering from accidents was much larger than that of females.

				<p>In proportion to the total population, sickness was not so rife, but disablement from accidents was more rife in 1871 than it was found to be in 1881, resulting,

			<p>however, in a greater amount of disablement from the two causes combined at the latter period than at the former. This applies both to males and females, the increased sickness being naturally due to the larger proportion of old people in the community, whilst the diminished disablement from accidents may be set down to the smaller proportion of persons following mining pursuits. The following are the proportions at the two periods :—</p>

				<p>Persons laid up by sickness and accidents are less numerous in proportion to population in rural than in urban districts, which is no doubt partly attributable to the fact that the hospitals situated in the latter receive the disabled residents of the former as well as those whose ordinary abode is within their own limits. The goldfields are scattered over these two divisions, and in point of liability to sickness occupy a position between them, the proportion of sufferers being greater than in the rural, but smaller than in the urban districts. Cases of accident amongst males are, however as may be supposed, more common on the gold-fields than in either of those districts taken as a whole.

				<p>It will be observed that the highest proportion of disabled persons is to be found amongst those whose occupation was not stated, the inference being that their disablement prevented them from pursuing any occupation. The next highest proportion was amongst persons of independent means, the next amongst labourers, the next amongst sailors, the next amongst mechanical engineers, cutlers, &amp;c., and the next amongst shipwrights, shipbuilders, &amp;c. After scholars, who were almost all children, the calling which showed the smallest proportion of disablement was that of domestic servants ; the next booksellers, bookbinders, lithographers, and print and picture sellers ; the next watchmakers, philosophical and surgical instrument makers and gunsmiths ; the next messengers, porters, and telegraph employes ; and the next lawyers, who were much more free from disabling illness than clergymen, who again were much more free than medical men. The disablement amongst miners, although much above the average, was not so great as that in many of the other callings.</p>

				<p>The deafmutes, the blind, the lunatics, the idiots, and the crippled, maimed, and deformed persons represent those having some defect or injury which is generally permanent, but which often does not disable them from following some description of labour, and does not always prevent them from earning their own livelihood, although no doubt in most cases it seriously affects their usefulness to the community. These numbered 4,445, viz., 2,627 males and 1,818 females, or 1 person in every 194, 1 male in every 172, and 1 female in every 226.

				<p>As a result of many of the blind having become so after they had reached a mature age, the occupations set down to them are of a much more varied character than those of the deaf and dumb. The young are educated at the Victorian Institution and School for the Blind, and are taught not only to read and write (in Braille), but receive instruction in vocal and instrumental music and such industrial pursuits as the blind are capable of learning. The trades most commonly taught are basket making, brush making, and mat making, the females learning also to perform household duties and to assist in the laundry, as well as to knit and sew. The following are the occupations returned at the Census as being those of the blind. Some of these callings were, no doubt, being practised by them at the time the Census was taken, whilst others were their former occupations or those they had followed before they lost their sight.

				<p>Epileptic persons were in the proportion of 3.36 per 10,000 of the population of Victoria, of 3.89 per 10,000 males, and of 2.78 per 10,000 females ; or in other words, 1 person in every 2,974, 1 male in every 2,569, 1 female in every 3,599 was subject to attacks of epilepsy.

				<p>The Census of England and Wales does not supply any information on the subject of epilepsy, and the only Australasian colony, except Victoria, which collects such information appears to be New Zealand, in which, according to the Census of 1881, the proportion of epileptic persons was 1 in every 2,525 of the population, there by showing a higher ratio of epilepsy than that found to prevail in Victoria.

				<p>Epileptic persons are to be found in every age-group up to that ended with 75 years, but no such persons appears in any older group. Up to a certain point the tendency to epilepsy seems to increase with age ; under 60 there was 1 epileptic person in every 3,089 of the population, whilst from 60 to 75 there was 1 in every 1,402 of the population.

				<p>No instruction was given the sub-enumerators to obtain returns of mutilated, crippled, and deformed persons, either in 1871 or 1881, but the schedules contained particulars respecting 205 such persons at the former, and 132 at the latter period. It may be supposed that all were not returned on either occasion, therefore no comparisons with the numbers of the population will be quoted here ; it is, however, suggested that at future Censuses of this colony an attempt should be made to obtain complete returns of the numbers affected in this manner.<div class="footnote">

The whole number of Chinese being 12,128, it follows that 1 in 48 was suffering from some description of infirmity, 1 in 81 was disabled from sickness or accident, 1 in about 6,000 was deaf and dumb, 1 in about 1,000 was blind, and 1 in 140 was lunatic. These figures, as compared with previous ones, show that the Chinese suffered less than the general population from each description of infirmity except insanity, but of that the proportion (1 in 140) was much higher than that obtaining in the general population (1 in 304). It must, however, he remembered that a very large majority of the Chinese were adults, and lunacy is not as a rule developed until after the period of puberty is reached.

			<h1 class="section-title">REMARKS AND SUGGESTIONS.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">534.</h3>
				<p>The Census which is the subject of this Report is the fourth enumeration of the population of this colony with which I have been connected, and the second of which I have had the management. In the course of nature it is not likely I shall take part in any such operation in future, which being the case I deem it right to embody the result of my experience in a few suggestions for the improvement of the system I have followed, which, if adopted will, I believe, lighten the labours of my successor, and contribute to the success of the Census of 1891, when the time arrives for giving effect to that undertaking.
						<span class="annotation"> [Remarks and suggestions.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">535.</h3>
				<p>The country is now almost entirely divided into municipal districts, and will doubtless be quite so divided by 1891. I would recommend that these districts, whether large (shires) or small (cities, towns, and boroughs), be made the Census districts ; for which they are admirably adapted, their boundaries being well known to the residents and easily discoverable upon the ground ; and as they have been made the basis of the electoral districts and divisions, much trouble will be saved in the arrangement and classification of the schedules after the Census has been taken.
						<span class="annotation"> [Census districts.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">536.</h3>
				<p>I would further strongly recommend that the council of each municipality be asked to nominate a suitable person to be the enumerator, with a suggestion that, unless some good reason should exist to the contrary, he should be the shire secretary, town clerk, or one of the other municipal officers. By this means an enumerator would be secured, generally a capable man, and almost invariably well acquainted with the district and with the most suitable persons to act as sub-enumerators, who should, as at present, be appointed by the enumerator. The enumerator should be paid according to a fixed scale, based upon the area of the district and the number of persons enumerated, such scale being higher in country than in urban municipalities.
						<span class="annotation"> [Enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">537.</h3>
				<p>In an early portion of this Report I mentioned the trouble I had had in settling the payments of the sub-enumerators after the Census was taken, in consequence of the attempts made by many of those officers to impose upon the Government by endeavouring to obtain payment for more time than they actually worked, and
						<span class="annotation"> [Sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_171"></div>
			<p>I suggested that the number of days' pay to be allowed for the enumeration of each sub-district should be arranged beforehand between the enumerator and the sub-enumerator. I lay great stress upon this suggestion, and to carry it into effect would recommend that agreements in duplicate be duly signed and witnessed—one copy to be kept by the enumerator and one by the sub-enumerator—in which the number of days allowed and the rate per day should be distinctly stated, the sub-enumerator being given to understand that the amount promised would not be reduced if he did the work in a shorter time, or increased should he take longer ; at the same time he should be under a penalty, to be prescribed by the Census Act, if he left the work unfinished, whether he could do it in the allotted time or not. The municipal officer who, according to the system I have proposed, would generally be the enumerator, would, from his knowledge of the district, be the best possible person to make these agreements with the sub-enumerators, and indeed in many cases, would be the only one who could do so without risk of injustice either to the sub-enumerator or to the Government.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">538.</h3>
				<p>On the present occasion the sub-enumerators were burdened with a great deal more work than had been allotted to their predecessors at former Censuses, which did not conduce to the success of the operation. Besides the householder's schedule, they had educational, agricultural, manufacturing, mining, and school schedules to deal with, or six schedules in all. To procure the information sought to be obtained in the last five schedules, it was necessary to take much more time than the sub-enumerator could well afford to devote to that work, or than was compatible with his more legitimate duties in connexion with the enumeration of the population which, as people are always moving from place to place, ought to be completed as speedily as possible. I would still propose to embody in the householder's schedule a provision for enumerating the live stock in the colony, as that can be correctly done only when a Census is taken ; but information as to agriculture, school attendance, manufactures, and mining can be secured with more accuracy by the ordinary municipal collectors than by the sub-enumerators. However tempting it may be when a Census is taken to endeavour to obtain information on a variety of interesting topics not immediately connected with the work on hand, it should be borne in mind that anything which tends to complicate the duties of the sub-enumerators cannot fail to act prejudicially on the correctness of the particulars they are specially appointed to secure.
						<span class="annotation"> [Extra schedules objectionable.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">539.</h3>
				<p>Much evil has been found to result from the householder's schedule being attached to the Census Act. I would recommend that, in future, only the heads of inquiry should be embodied in the Act, on which a schedule, to be approved by the Governor in Council and gazetted, should afterwards be based. There are matters of detail in this schedule which it is sometimes desirable to vary even at the last
						<span class="annotation"> [Householder's schedule.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_172"></div>
			<p>moment, and this could be done if the schedule were, within certain limits, merely a matter of regulation ; whereas, hitherto, the Act once passed, however desirable it might be to effect changes, it has been impossible to alter the form of the schedule in the slightest degree.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">540.</h3>
				<p>The inquiries under the column in the householder's schedule headed "Health" I think might with advantage be extended so as to embrace some matters respecting which particulars are not now supplied. The column contains provision for obtaining the numbers sick, suffering from accidents, deaf and dumb, blind, lunatic, idiotic, epileptic, and leprous. I would suggest that inquiry should also be made as to the number of cripples ; of humpbacked, clubfooted, or otherwise deformed persons ; of paralysed persons ; of those who have lost a limb or an eye ; of those who are partially blind or color-blind ; of those who are deaf without being dumb ; and of imbecile persons not strictly speaking idiots. Information on all these points might be obtained without additional trouble or expense by merely altering the instruction at the head of the column so as to state what is required. This column, instead of "Health" as at present, might with greater propriety be headed "Infirmity."
						<span class="annotation"> ["Health" column.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">541.</h3>
				<p>It is incumbent upon me in this place to say a word respecting the class of officers who are usually appointed to compile the Census, a matter to which I have already referred in a previous paragraph.<div class="footnote">
						<p>1 See paragraph 44<span class="emphasis">ante.</span></p>
					</div>As, however, the subject is a delicate one, and the Government have expressed their intention to abolish political patronage throughout the Public Service, whereby the evil complained of will probably be reduced to a minimum in future, I shall touch upon it but lightly. Suffice it to say that it is a mistake to suppose that incapable persons can be made useful in the compilation of a Census. All the work in connexion with that operation is of a more intricate and difficult character than that which occurs in the routine of most Government departments ; to the bulk of those appointed it is necessarily entirely novel, it is therefore desirable that they should have had a good plain education, and that they should possess quickness of comprehension and aptitude for grasping fresh subjects, as well as a fair share of ordinary intelligence. As it is impossible to judge accurately of a man's capabilities beforehand, it is not to be supposed that all appointed will possess the requisite qualifications, but when it is discovered that such qualities are absent in an officer, or when his conduct is such as to be subversive of the discipline of the office, the head of the Census Department ought to have the power to dispense with his services.
						<span class="annotation"> [Census office staff.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">542.</h3>
				<p>Following the practice which had prevailed at a former Census, the Census vote on the present occasion was set down on the Estimates in the division of the
						<span class="annotation"> [Census vote.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_173"></div>
			<p>Chief Secretary, instead of that of the Government Statist, and much inconvenience was experienced in consequence. The effect of this peculiar disposition of the Census vote was that all the accounts of the Census had to be passed through the books of the two departments, and signed by the Under Secretary as well as by the Government Statist, for which there was no necessity whatever, and from which no good resulted. Moreover, the Government Statist was in the position that, although he had the expenditure of the money, he never knew exactly how the Census vote stood, and what balance remained to its credit. So much evil was found to arise from the arrangement that when, at the beginning of the next financial year, a further vote was required for the compilation of the Census, there was no hesitation whatever in placing the amount in the Government Statist's division of the Estimates. I strongly recommend that, in future, the money for taking as well as for compiling the Census be placed directly under the department by which it is to be expended.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">543.</h3>
				<p>It being important to know the number of natives of Victoria settled in the different Australasian colonies, so as to arrive as nearly as possible at the whole number of Victorians living, it is desirable that the other colonies of the group should be asked to tabulate their returns of birthplaces in such a manner that Victorians may be shown. This request should be made some time before the Census is taken, in order that it may reach the respective colonies before their compilation forms are prepared. On the occasion of the Census of 1881, three of the colonies<div class="footnote">
						<p>South Australia, Western Australia, and New Zealand ; the returns of which, especially those of the last-named, were, with this exception, compiled in an exceedingly creditable manner.</p>
					</div>were unable to give the number of natives of Victoria living within their borders, although the numbers born in some of the least important foreign countries and British Possessions out of Australasia were shown in their tables with the greatest minuteness. I need scarcely say that the Victorian Census returns contain a statement of the number of natives of each of the other Australasian colonies found to be resident in this colony.
						<span class="annotation"> [Victorians in other colonies.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">544.</h3>
				<p>Every colony of the group except New South Wales is at one with Victoria in regard to the general principles of tabulating the Census returns. It is in the highest degree desirable that an endeavour should be made to induce the non-accordant colony to assimilate her forms, especially those relating to the occupations of the people, with the forms used by her neighbours ; also that an understanding should be arrived at in regard to minor points of difference which still exist between Victoria and those colonies which are in the main in unison with her. One of the most important of these is in reference to the treatment of the indefinite groups which exist under most of the heads of inquiry, the component parts of which ought always to be separately shown. Thus, in the return of Religions there are groups styled
						<span class="annotation"> [Uniformity of compilation desirable in Australasian colonies.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_174"></div>
			<p>"Other Presbyterians," " Other Wesleyans," "Other Protestants," "Other Religions ;" in that of Birthplaces there are "Other British Possessions," "Other Countries ;" and in that of Occupations there are over 60 such groups, as, for instance, "Others" connected with "Government," "Defence," "Religion," "Law," "Medicine," &amp;c., the composition of each of which is shown in the returns of Victoria and New Zealand, but to a less perfect extent, or not at all, in those of the other colonies ; New South Wales making no attempt whatever to show anything beyond the very incomplete and indefinite particulars appearing upon the face of her tables. It is desirable to arrange that in all the colonies the same exactness of detail as in the two colonies named should in this respect be followed. The Chinese and Aborigines also should be tabulated separately under all the heads of inquiry, so as to allow of their being separated if desired. It will readily be understood that a large number of Pagans (Chinese) or of persons of no religion (Aborigines) lowers the proportion to the total population of each of the religions of persons of European birth and extraction, respecting whom it is especially intended that the Census shall supply exact information. The returns of education and conjugal condition are also much disturbed by the presence of these two races, and the other inquiries in a less degree. In many respects it is desirable that it should be possible to eliminate them from the remainder of the population, which in several of the colonies cannot now be done. A Census being so expensive, difficult, and infrequent an operation, it is obviously desirable that all possible details that can be obtained without too great an expenditure of time and labour should be got from the returns, and that everything should be done to make the published information as accurate and complete as possible. All these matters, as well as some other points of less importance, ought to be discussed and settled at a conference to be held about twelve months before the next Census is taken, so as to allow sufficient time for making the preparations necessary to give effect to such principles as might be agreed upon.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">545.</h3>
				<p>I would strongly advise that the system of compiling the Census by means of cards should be continued, as I believe it to be more accurate as well as more convenient than any other method. I have, in an early portion of this Report,<div class="footnote">
						<p>See paragraphs 49 to 53<span class="emphasis">ante.</span></p>
					</div>given information as to the way in which the cards should be used, and have mentioned that a fuller account containing further details, together with particulars of improvements in the manner of working the cards which experience had suggested, had been written out and was kept for record in this office. I also recommended that, besides the white and pink cards used for tabulating the results of the principal
						<span class="annotation"> [Compilation by cards.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_175"></div>
			<p>inquiries, cards of another color should be provided for duplicating the information relating to classes of persons respecting whom special information might be required. About 100,000 of these duplicate cards would probably be wanted, three-fourths of which should be of one color, say blue or green for males, and one-fourth of another color, say yellow or drab for females.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">546.</h3>
				<p>It would much simplify the compilation by cards if provision were made for tabulating the results of the six principal inquiries, viz., Birthplace, Religion, Age, Education, Conjugal Condition, and Occupation upon one sheet, in which case a single sheet for males and another sheet for females would be devoted to each place it might be desired to keep separate. The entries of the cards relating to that place might then all be made by the same officer, after which those particular cards would be entirely done with. Before parting with the sheet, it would be incumbent upon this officer to see that the totals under all the heads of inquiry balanced with each other and with the correct total of the place, which would be known beforehand by means of the first tabulation (Inhabitants and Houses), and perfect accuracy would thus be secured. Such a sheet could be constructed without difficulty, and it need not be of a very large size.
						<span class="annotation"> [Single sheet for tabulating results.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">547.</h3>
				<p>I have caused several complete sets of the forms used at the Census of 1881 to be carefully put away for the benefit of my successor, but they ought to be all intelligently revised before being made to serve as patterns in connexion with another Census. The occupation forms especially should be thoroughly examined and compared with the occupation tables of England and Wales 1881 (not yet published), with the view of adopting changes which may have been made therein since the previous decennial Census, so far as such alterations may be deemed suitable to the circumstances of this colony. Moreover, some instances will be discovered in the present forms, of industries being of such trifling importance in Victoria that their names may, with advantage, be removed from the general tables of occupations, and the small number of persons following them be grouped in the line "Others" and described in footnotes ; whilst, on the other hand, a few cases will be found of occupations now grouped with "Others," and mentioned only in footnotes, being of sufficient importance to be assigned lines in the tables. In revising the forms for tabulating the Religions, it would be well to appropriate a line to the Bible Christians under the general head of Methodists, of which body they are a branch, instead of placing them under "Other Protestants" as at present, which, although done at the request of one of the Bible Christian ministers who, at the time, was supposed to have sufficient authority for his action, has been the cause of some dissatisfaction.

				<p>In concluding this Report, I desire to acknowledge the ready assistance I received from other Government departments in many of the operations connected with the Census. Amongst these I would especially mention the Crown Lands Office, on which I made large and constant demands for maps, which were always responded to with an alacrity which left nothing to be desired ; also the Post and Telegraph Office, which, by prompt delivery of letters, parcels, and telegrams to the Census office in Melbourne and to its subordinates in country districts, often at other times than the regular deliveries, contributed much to the convenience of those engaged ; also the Police Department, which, by posting notices respecting the Census throughout the length and breadth of the colony, protecting the sub-enumerators when visiting places frequented by the criminal classes, and, in many instances, reporting cases of omission, rendered efficient help ; also the Government Printing Office, on which a large amount of extra labour was imposed by the ruling and printing of the hundreds of thousands of forms and other documents used at different stages of the work.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">573.</h3>
				<p>Finally, it is only right I should give credit to those who have been intimately associated with me in carrying out the important national undertaking which the Parliament of this colony entrusted to my charge. And first, I would refer to Mr. Joseph Hart, whose name I have already mentioned as having had the immediate supervision of the large extra staff employed to compile the Census, and whose zeal and assiduity have been beyond all praise. I would also refer to Mr. H. A. Hendren, the senior clerk and accountant of the Department, whose ordinary duties were much added to for many months by the care of the Census accounts and the</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_182"></div>
			<p>payment of the indoor and outdoor staff, and all other claims arising out of the Census, a service which from first to last he conducted without any hitch or difficulty whatever ; also to Mr. John Mathewson, who often assisted in the work of supervision, and was of much use in constructing tables, computing averages, percentages, &amp;c., and many other ways ; also to Mr. Charles Farmer, a draftsman temporarily transferred to the Census office from the Crown Lands Department, who proved himself to be possessed of more than ordinary skill and intelligence. Other members of the permanent and temporary staffs also rendered good service, and heartily co-operated with me and with each other in bringing the work of the Census to a successful termination.</p>

This officer has exercised much thoughtful care in the checking and verification referred to, and I do not think it probable that any important error has escaped observation. Should, however, a mistake be discovered, I shall feel obliged for information as to its nature and position.</p>

			<p>LETTER RESPECTING THE BELIEF OF THE CHINESE IN GOD, ADDRESSED BY MR. C. P. HODGES, CHINESE INTERPRETER, MELBOURNE, TO THE GOVERNMENT STATIST.</p>
			<p>To H. H. HAYTER, Esq., C.M.G., Government Statist.</p>
			<p>DEAR SIR,</p>
			<p>I observe that in the Census returns the Chinese have been again put down "Pagans," a term which is objectionable, inasmuch as it conveys the idea that to each may be applied the words "The fool hath said in his heart there is no God." Indeed it seems to be almost everywhere accepted that the Chinese, as a nation, are Atheists. If any difference of opinion exists, it is as to the way by which they have sunk into that state, whether by reasoning themselves into Atheism, or through incapacity to conceive the initiatory idea necessary to a discussion of the question. Both sections, however, are persuaded that they have changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image like into corruptible man. In many things the Chinese are misunderstood—therefore misjudged—but in few more than on the subject specially referred to. It is not my intention in writing you to attempt to go fully into Chinese faiths. It would take more time than I could well spare, and may prove tedious to you. I do, however, hope that you will not allow your Report on the last Census to issue without, as a mild protest, expressing a doubt that the Chinese are a nation of fools, according to David's description of one. So far as my own experience enables me to form a judgement, the Chinese ideas of God may be thus epitomized :— "A spirit almighty, omnipresent, omniscient, benevolent, perfectly just, and good, the rewarder of good and punisher of evil, exercising as minutely observant and far extending a providence as that expressed in the words 'Verily I say unto you, but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.'" The difficulty which besets the inquirer is the use in the canonical books of Confucius, their great teacher and master, of the word "Heaven" for "God." At first sight it would appear of small moment by what name the Supreme was called if the attributes of Deity are ascribed to the object. It will, however, be presently seen that the effect on the Chinese has been to lead them far astray. In almost any Chinese store may be purchased for a shilling a book entitled, "Meng slim po kawm"—(The preciously valuable mirror for seeing and trying the heart.) No unprejudiced person could read through that work and then not hesitate to pronounce the Chinese to be pagans in the usual acceptation of that word. It contains extracts from the classics and noted ethical writers. A few unselected sentences will, I venture to think, convince you that such a result would be highly probable. To give the names of the authors would not further my purpose. I therefore omit them in the following extracts :—"If good or evil be done there must be the due recompense." "He who is virtuous Heaven rewards with blessings and happiness." "He who is not virtuous is visited with calamity." "The door of evil might fly high or run far, but escape is very difficult." "The rewarding of good and the punishment of evil is only a question of time, whether it shall be soon or late." "Every aspiration for good is known to Heaven." "Those who obey the commands of Heaven are preserved, the disobedient and rebellious are destroyed." "Heaven hears, though there is not the faintest sound." "Where does Heaven make its inquisition, not high, not far, but only in the hearts of men." "The most secretly uttered words Heaven hears as thunder ; the small defects of the heart, though a person be in the sacredly secret chamber, are seen by the spirit with eyes of lightning." Does not this last quotation call to mind the opening sentences of the most solemn prayer in the Church of England liturgy, "Almighty God unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid." Many more translations could be given demonstrating that the belief in this "Heaven" is a belief in "God." But, as it would manifestly be more fair to judge from the sacred writings, I will do so. The well known Revd. Dr. Legge, perhaps the first Chinese scholar of the day, thus gives the</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_184"></div>
			<p>meaning of "Heaven" as used in the books of Confucius, "the material heaven and firmament,<span class="emphasis">more commonly</span>the character (Teen), stands for the Supreme Governing Power, the author of man's nature and orderer of his lot." The language of the Chinese sages does not approach the sublimity of the Hebrew prophets, but often the same current of thought can be distinctly traced. For instance, "What Heaven has conferred is called the Nature. Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is surely bountiful to them according to their qualities." ("Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about"—job.) ("He fashioned their hearts alike"—Psalms.) Speaking of the Emperor Shun, it is said, "He received from Heaven the emoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne, sending from Heaven those favours, as it were, repeatedly. Oh ! you Shun, the Heaven determined succession now rests in your person, sincerely hold fast the mean." ("By me kings reign and princes decree justice"—Prov.) "The doings of the Supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing." ("God doeth great things and unsearchable. Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not ; he passeth on also, but I perceive him not"—Job.) "Heaven is going to use your Master as a bell with its wooden tongue to call the people to hear the truth." ("Now then we are ambassadors"—Paul.) "Heaven produced the virtue that is in me." ("Every good and perfect gift is from above"—Jas.) "If Heaven had wished the cause of truth to perish, then I, a future mortal should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of Kwang do to me?" ("If God be for us, who can be against us?"—Paul.) "Tsze does not acquiesce in the judgment of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him." ("I have seen the wicked flourish like a green bay tree"—Psalms.) "Death and life have their determined appointment—riches and honour depend on Heaven." ("My times are in Thy hand"—Psalms.) ("Both riches and honour come of Thee, and Thou reignest over all"—Jer.) "The superior man stands in awe of the ordinances of Heaven. The mean man does not know the ordinances of Heaven, therefore does not stand in awe of them." ("The law of his God is in his heart"—Psalms.) ("But fools despise wisdom"—Prov.) "Does Heaven speak? The four seasons pursue their course, all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven say anything ?" ("To everything there is a season"—Eccle.) ("Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created, and Thou renewest the face of the earth"—Psalms.) Against such quotations as these it is urged that the Chinese do not invest Heaven with a personality, that they do not individualise it. Dr. Moorhouse recently said at Castlemaine that "God cannot be understood," and the Chinese do not presume to comprehend him. The language we use they adopt—"To whom then will ye liken God, or what likeness will ye compare unto him?" A Chinese writer says, "Had Heaven no designing mind, then it must happen that a cow might bring forth a horse, and on the peach tree be produced the blossoms of the pear." By another, Heaven is explained as the lofty One who is on high, language closely like that of Isaiah, who speaks of "the high and lofty One." If there is a personality and individuality expressed by the latter, why not by the former? In the works of the old writers, before Mencius or Confucius, the word "Te" or "Shang Te" is undoubtedly used for a personal being, the supreme ruler in heaven and on earth. In the books of Confucius the word "Te" only occurs once in this sense, and in that instance in a quotation made up of sentences from the Shoo King. The passage is a rather remarkable one, "I, the child Le, presume to use a dark-coloured victim, and I presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the sinners I dare not pardon, and thy ministers I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is in thy mind, O God. If in my person I commit offences they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offences, those offences must rest on my person." I may remark in passing, that a portion of this paragraph was inserted in the proclamation issued by the Emperor during the last famine. In the works of Mencius the word occurs once in a quotation from the She King, and once in a sentence taken from the Shoo King, and once he himself uses it instead of the generally used word "Heaven." That taken from the She King, or book of poetry, speaks of</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_185"></div>
			<p>"God having passed his decree." The Shoo King, a book of history, asserts that Heaven having produced the inferior people, appointed for them rulers and teachers, with the purpose that they should be assisting to God ; and, therefore, distinguished them throughout the four quarters of the empire—a passage an equivalent to which can be found in Romans—"For there is no power but of God, the powers that be are ordained of God (the power) is the minister of God to thee for good, the minister of God to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil." Where Mencius uses the word "Te," the sentence enjoins penitence, penance, and purity as the three necessary conditions upon which a man may approach the Deity. Further, the language without undue straining may be taken to affirm the necessity which exists for a means to propitiate the Deity. Though a man, he says, may be wicked, yet if he adjust his thoughts, fast, and bathe, he may sacrifice to God. At the same time, man is warned that though he be virtuous all his life his goodness is neither perfect nor sufficient. In a Chinese commentary on the word prayer as used in the Confucian Analects it is defined "as the expression of repentance, and promise of amendment ; without these, prayer is useless." It is, I am sure, a work of supererogation to remind you of the frequent use of the words "clean hands," and "clean heart," in the Biblical writings. It should be mentioned that at no time, from the earliest history of the Chinese, whether authenticated or palpably fabulous, down to the present moment, can there be found anything to convey the slightest idea that they have thought of fashioning a likeness of Shang. Te the Supreme. The learned Dr. Morrison thus sums up his views on the Chinese ideas of God : "The philosophers of China have groped as men in the dark in their reasoning respecting the Deity, but they can scarcely be said to have found him. They have come to the conclusion that every chain must have a first link, every consecutive series must have a beginning, every produced being seems to imply one original and unproduced ; but of that self-existent cause or Being they have attained a very imperfect knowledge." Without stopping to answer the question—how much more would we have known than they without that revelation which has brought life and immortality to light?—Dr. Morrison certainly acquits the Chinese from the charge of being a people to whom God is unknown or being known is unrecognized. The Chinese set up images, and bow down before them, but there are people not described as Pagans who do much the same thing. "Logicians," to quote Macaulay, "may reason about abstractions, but the great mass of men must have images. The strong tendency of the multitude in all ages and nations to idolatry can be explained on no other principle. The first inhabitants of Greece, there is reason to believe, worshipped one invisible Deity. But the necessity of having something more definite to adore produced in a few centuries the innumerable crowd of gods and goddesses * * *. Reformers have often made a stand against these feelings, but never with more than apparent and partial success. The men who demolished images in cathedrals have not always been able to demolish those which were enshrined in their minds." So much by way of reasonable apology for an infirmity which under peculiar circumstances has been more fully developed in the Chinese than it otherwise would have been. The substitution of the word "Heaven" for "God," and their joint use by Confucius and Mencius, has produced confusion in the Chinese mind, giving it no settled point on which to fix its attention. Neither of the sages wished in this respect to alter the religion of their country, but they did, as Dr. Legge affirms, "make way for the grosser conceptions of the modern literati, who would often seem to deny the divine personality altogether, and substitute for both God and Heaven a new principle of order or fitness of things." It is by writers of the latter class that much of western opinion has been formed, so that the allegation that the Chinese believe in God is come to be deemed a myth. During my intercourse with the Chinese, I have again and again discovered the difficulty they have in maintaining the mind in that state of fixity which Confucius compares to the north polar star which keeps its place, and all the stars turn towards it. The duality of supremes—supreme heaven and supreme earth—has left "the people in the mass to become an easy prey to the idolatrous fooleries of Buddism." A Chinaman on one occasion said to me, "Shang Te, the Supreme God over all, is in Heaven ; without him there would be no (non-physical)</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_186"></div>
			<p>Heaven." He averred that Shang Te was Supreme, but his language conveyed to me neither a clear uniting or disseverance of the two objects. This mischief has been caused by transferring to Heaven all the attributes of Shang Te, and yet not detracting from the power and authority of the latter and true Deity. Although Confucius adopted so exclusively the use of the word "Heaven" to represent the Supreme Governing Power, yet the fact of his quoting the Shoo is substantially an adoption of the writings. He declared himself to be a transmitter, not an inventor or maker. To him has been ascribed, with much disputation, the compilation of the books which compose the Shoo, and the authorship of the preface ; but whether he wrote the one or did the other, or neither, there is ample reason otherwise for saying that he stamped them with his authority, and that by so doing he caused them to be classed as canonical. This is all the more noteworthy, because those chronicles mention not only Shang Te as God, but Heaven also as the hall of God, and the happy abode of good spirits with him. I have not been able to find any competent authority on the five canonical books which encourages the idea that the Chinese had any knowledge of the coming of Christ and his mission. But on one point, and up to a certain point, the language of Confucius and Job are alike. "He who offends against Heaven," says the former, "has none to whom he can pray." "Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand on us both," is the language of Job. I venture to entertain the thought that in the tone of lament in which the Chinese sage gives utterance, there may be heard also the expression of a desire, and an admission of the necessity for a mediator of no common sort to reconcile man to God. Such an idea is in no way antagonistic, but rather in harmony with the precepts he taught. Idolatry he nowhere inculcated. It is recorded of him that he sacrificed to the Spirits as though they were present. An expression, it is fair to say, has exposed him to the charge of preaching a Sadducean philosophy, but which I fail to find justification for. Men and women whose virtues during life, whether of patriotism and valour, honour to parents, or works of benevolence have been considered sufficient to entitle them to that honour have had the dignity of gods and goddesses conferred on them. This act of deification, performed by the Emperor who claims to be the son of Heaven or Heaven's vicegerent on earth, would, with us, be called canonization. Around those, and others, there is often a thick cloud of silly fable. And what calendar of saints is free from the ridiculous ? Kwan Kung, the person to whose honour and worship the temple at Emerald Hill is erected, is a deified warrior and patriot—a Chinese Wellington—invested with an intercessory office. A few translations of the illuminated writings suspended from the walls may possibly take away from the place a little of the pagan character you have doubtless considered attaches to it :—"It is only virtue which can help." "Assist all the nations to live in harmony." "Great righteousness, pure faithfulness." "Examine the heart." "Be pure and reverential." " In aiming at truthfulness and faithfulness, remember the brilliancy of the sun and moon ; those virtues will make your heart as lustrous." " In aiming at righteousness, remember the clouds of heaven ; the influence of righteousness is as extensive as they, and as harmonizing as the colours of the rainbow." But the day is coming when the Chinese shall cast their idols to the moles and to the bats. I know they are considered an unimpressionable people. It is a mistake to think so. When the door of China was forced open, it was thought most certainly that the population would still remain within. What has been the result of breaking down her isolation ? Her people have spread over the face of the earth, penetrating every land. Their love of country leads very many of them back, but each one takes with him new ideas, especially so on the administration of the law and the government of the people. The very cause which takes them home seems to be a providential ordering, so that by the continual dropping the hard stone of prejudice might be worn away. There is a healthy restlessness in the hearts of thousands which will not be quieted until great changes are accomplished. They have had little encouragement from other nations to effect the religious and political reform of their country. The first is an essential forerunner of the second. The teachings of her sages go so far parallel with those of Christ that it could be said of those of Mencius, "There is enough in them if the conscience be but quickened by the spirit of God to make the</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1881-census_02-13_187"></div>
			<p>haughtiest scholar cry out 'O, wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?" The principle of universal love is inculcated in the all-embracing expression, "Benevolence is the wide house of the world for man to dwell in." The golden maxim, "Do ye unto others as ye would that others should do unto you," is three times preached by Confucius in almost the same words. The question whether man is by nature evil or good has not escaped the attention of Chinese philosophers, some, like Mencius, advocating the goodness of man, others his evil nature. The Chinese scholar, to whom I have frequently referred, remarks that "The constitution of man's nature, and how far it supplies to him a rule of conduct and a law of duty, are inquiries than which there can hardly be any others of more importance." They were largely discussed in the schools of Greece ; a hundred vigorous and acute minds of modern Europe have occupied themselves with them. It will hardly be questioned in England that the place for clear and just thinking on the subject belongs to Bishop Butler ; but his views and those of Mencius are as nearly as possible identical. There is a difference of nomenclature and a combination of parts in which the advantage is with the Christian prelate. Felicity of expression and charm of style belong to the Chinese philosopher, than whom never did Christian priest lift up his mitred front or show his Geneva gown more loftily in courts and palaces than Mencius, the teacher, demeaned himself. The first twenty-three years of his life synchronized with the last twenty-three of Plato's. Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, Demosthenes, and other great men of the west, were also his contemporaries. When we place Mencius among them, he can look them in the face ; he does not need to hide a diminished head. Let it not be thought that either the ancient writings or the books of Confucius are as sealed to the masses ; they are the fountains of honour and emolument. The books and the standard commentaries are universally studied.</p>
			<p>If I have apparently departed from my first intention to confine my remarks strictly to the subject of the Chinese belief in the existence of God, it has been only in the hope of showing that when we endeavour to teach the Chinese of God we should not go to them with the charge of David on our tongue, but that with propriety we could follow the example of St. Paul at Athens, and say, "Whom ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."</p>

		<p>The blue bars indicate males, the pink bars females. The figures at the head of the diagram represent the ages in quinquennial periods. The space between any two of the cross lines represents 1,000 persons. Each bar, from top to bottom, represents the whole number of persons living at the period of age indicated by the figures at its head ; the portion of the bar entirely filled with colour represents those who could read and write, the portion filled with diagonal lines those who could read only and not write, and the open portion those who could not read. Its is evident that those who could read are represented by the space extending from the bottom of the bar to the upper part of the portion filled with diagonal lines, but only those of them represented by the space entirely filled with colour could also write.
