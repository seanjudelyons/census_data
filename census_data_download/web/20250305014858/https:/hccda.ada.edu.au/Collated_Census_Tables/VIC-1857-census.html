        <p>Registrar General's Office,</p>
        <p>5th November, 1857.</p>
        <p>SIR,</p>
        <p>I have the honor to submit the following Tables, forming Part the First of the Returns of the Census of the Population of Victoria, taken on the twenty-ninth day of March, One thousand eight hundred and fifty seven.The Summary Tables shew :—</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>The population of the Counties and of the Pastoral Districts at the censuses of 1851, 1854, and 1857 ; the area in square miles and statute acres, and the proportion of persons and houses to the area ; with the proportional increase of persons, males and females.</p>

            <p>The population of the Counties and Pastoral Districts, inclusive as well as exclusive of Chinese and Aborigines ; the number of persons living in tents and camping out ; the number of Chinese and Aborigines ; and of the houses inhabited, uninhabited, and building, with their classification according to materials and size.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The population of the Electoral Districts of the Legislative Assembly, inclusive and exclusive of Chinese and Aborigines ; the number of persons living in houses and in tents respectively (exclusive of Chinese and Aborigines in both returns) ; the number of inhabited and uninhabited houses, and of those building ; also the number constructed of stone and brick, wood or iron, or canvas.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The population of the Electoral Provinces of the Legislative Council, inclusive and exclusive of Chinese and Aborigines ; the population living in tents ; the travelers camping out, inclusive of Chinese ; the number of Chinese and Aborigines ; and the number of houses inhabited, uninhabited, and building, with their classification according to materials and size.</p>

            <p>The population of the Census Districts ; the number of Chinese and Aborigines ; the number of persons residing in brick and stone buildings, in wood and iron houses, and of those dwelling in tents ; and the number of travelers camping out on the day of the census.</p>

        </ol>
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-01_4"></div>
        <p>The serious difficulties which had been experienced on previous occasions in obtaining a correct census of the population of this colony, arising from the absence of any minute subdivision of the country into convenient districts having well defined boundaries, and from the migratory habits of a large proportion of the people, induced the Government to decide on appointing a commission for the purpose of making the preliminary arrangements for taking the census of 1857, preparing the form of schedule to be filled up by the householder, and framing proper regulations and instructions for the guidance of the officers engaged in carrying out the provisions of the Act.</p>
        <p>This commission consisted of William Westgarth, Thomas Herbert Power, and Duncan Longden, Esquires, with the Registrar General as chairman ; Messrs. Robert Brough Smyth and Francis A. Corbett being the joint secretaries. By these latter appointments, the resources available from the Surveyor General's department, and the experience acquired in taking the census of 1854, were brought to bear upon the present important undertaking.</p>
        <p>At the outset the commissioners decided on adopting the principle of popularizing as much as possible this national work, by endeavoring to enlist (that which was on every ground so desirable) the co-operation of the municipal and other similar local authorities, and by availing themselves of the experience and personal acquaintance with the country of residents in every district. With this view they placed themselves in communication with the chairmen of the municipalities, local courts, and road boards, and issued circulars containing a series of enquiries, the replies to which afforded much valuable information respecting the proper boundaries of districts, and furnished other details enabling arrangements to be made which tended greatly to the successful result of the commissioners' labors.</p>
        <p>Not the least among the many advantages obtained by this course, was, that these public bodies, possessing naturally the general confidence through their elective character, lent the most effectual and valuable aid in dispelling misapprehensions entertained by the people as to the value and real objects of a census ; misapprehensions which had on previous occasions interposed serious obstacles, and caused needless delay, expense, and incorrectness in the results obtained.</p>
        <p>The commissioners were thus enables to frame a scheme of subdivision of the colony, whereby the greater part of the enumeration was taken and supervised by means of local agency ; the enumerators being selected by the local authorities, but appointed by and made responsible to the Government. Where the assistance of such public bodies was not available, the commissioners selected persons who appeared to them likely to prove efficient from their experience and knowledge of the country.</p>
        <p>Each of the enumerators was supplied with two maps of his district ; one for his own use, the other to be returned to the commissioners, marked with such boundaries of subdivisions as he considered most advisable. He was especially required to point out on the map to the sub-enumerators, the precise bounds of their respective districts : and it was his duty to deliver to them a sufficiency of blank householders' schedules, with the instructions for their guidance, and to see that all thoroughly understood how their work was to be done. The sub-enumerators were engaged by the enumerators at the rates of remuneration recommended by the local authorities. Appendices A, B, C, and D, afford detailed information as to the nature of the instructions issued to the local bodies, and to the enumerators and sub-enumerators respectively, for the proper performance of their duties.</p>
        <p>One of these regulations subsequently proved to be of the utmost value in correcting the returns when they reached the Registrar General's office ; namely, that of requiring each sub-enumerator to fill up a return, shewing the name and residence of every householder with whom he had</p>
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-01_5"></div>
        <p>left a blank schedule. Through these returns the loss of many schedules, which had either not been called for, or had miscarried in transmission to the office, was discovered, and measures were promptly taken to rectify the omissions. Appendix E shews the form of the schedule which the house holder was required to fill up, and Appendix F that of the sub-enumerator's return.</p>
        <p>Where practicable, the districts were subdivided (See Appendix C), so that each sub-enumerator should have assigned to him a sufficient extent of ground to occupy him on Saturday in distributing the blank schedules ; Monday and Tuesday being allowed to him for calling at the houses for the schedules, which were to be filled up with the names and other required particulars respecting the persons who had slept in each domicile on the night of Sunday, 29th March, 1857. The reason for fixing upon this particular night is to be found in the circumstance, that the mining population, who form more than a third of the inhabitants of the colony, cease to work on Sunday, and are therefore more likely to be found at home on that day.</p>
        <p>The householders' schedules, being deemed confidential, were forwarded direct to the Registrar General by the enumerators after they had examined them ; but the sub-enumerators' returns were submitted to the municipalities and other local-authorities, in order that their general completeness might be ascertained and verified ; it being considered that the elected representatives of the various districts would be able to perceive, on inspection, whether the localities they represented had been thoroughly gone over by the census officers.</p>
        <p>The colony was divided into 60 census districts, which were again subdivided into 907 sub-enumerators' districts. In Appendix G will be found descriptions of the boundaries of the census districts ; and the map which accompanies these tables may hereafter be useful in assigning limits to districts for police, municipal, electoral, or other purposes.</p>
        <p>The total number of persons employed in collecting these returns was 1005, of whom 60 were enumerators, 930 were sub-enumerators, and 15 were Chinese interpreters or assistant sub-enumerators. Of the sub-enumerators no fewer than 477 had necessarily to perform their duties on horseback ; a circumstance which greatly increased the expense, but was quite unavoidable in sparsely peopled districts, where the inhabitants are often located many miles apart. The labor which devolved on the commissioners' office in organizing, instructing, and corresponding with so numerous a staff, has been very heavy.</p>
        <p>Exclusive of printing, postage, and of the expenses of the central office, the cost of collecting this census has been £15,741 2s., of which £13,385 19s. was paid to the sub-enumerators, and £1,855 11s. 6d. to the enumerators. The average cost per thousand persons has consequently been £38 6s. 6d., being considerably higher than the cost of taking the previous census, which was at the rate of £31 4s. 6d. per thousand persons. This increased cost is attributable to the fact of the census of 1854 having been to a considerable extent taken through the agency of stipendiary magistrates and the police force, who received payment only for what was considered their actual expenses. Independently, however, of the mistrust which is frequently caused from the fact that the idea of taxation is, in the minds of many of the people, associated with the interposition of the police in collecting returns, it will be seen that the principle adopted by the commissioners, namely, calling in the aid of elective bodies, did not admit of such a course.</p>
        <p>Turning now to the results which have been obtained through the medium of this extensive organization as exhibited in the accompanying tables, it should be observed that when compared with the difficulties which have always been experienced in the United Kingdom and in other European</p>
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-01_6"></div>
        <p>countries, in inducing people to give accurate information on points which, although highly important in a statistical review of the State, appear to them to relate merely to matters of personal interest, the householders' schedules must be considered, upon the whole, as filled up in a satisfactory manner, so much so indeed as to lead to the conclusion that the people of this colony are alive to the utility of all information which tends to throw light on the general condition of the community ; and that they comprehend that particulars obtained about the individual are absorbed in the general returns of large numbers—that the results alone are retained and published for public use.</p>
        <p>With the view of satisfying themselves as to the degree of reliance which ought to be placed on these returns, the commissioners instituted enquiry into every instance of complaint of irregularity, whether made directly to themselves or indirectly through the press. These certainly have not been numerous ; a fact which is in itself evidence favorable to the manner in which the census has been taken. With but few exceptions, the complaints were found either to have been hastily made, or wholly without foundation. As might have been expected, some mistakes occurred from misapprehension of the boundaries of districts, but in most cases they were rectified by the enumerators, even before the receipt of instructions from the central office.</p>
        <p>One cause of loss in the enumeration was found in the absence of persons from their dwellings when the sub-enumerators called for the schedules, without its being possible to obtain information respecting them from their neighbors. This loss has been less than might have been expected, owing to the praiseworthy zeal displayed by many of the collectors in revisiting the tents both before and after the usual working hours.</p>
        <p>A careful estimate of the number of persons thus omitted from the enumeration, shews that they cannot be set down at less than 4189. In forming this estimate, it has been assumed that those dwellings which were uniformly closed during the day were inhabited only by males. In other cases of loss, arising, for example, from removals, the computation has been made from a comparison of the average number of males and females residing in similar habitations in the same district.</p>
        <p>While the great fact presented by the census returns is the extraordinary increase of the population, amounting to 173,968 persons, or 73 per cent. within a period of less than three years, it will be noticed that the rough returns laid before Parliament early in this session made the number of the people much less than it has proved to be after a careful examination of the census papers. A large portion of this difference arose from the omission of the Chinese by some of the collectors, and from misentries and false additions in the returns originally sent in ; while many uncollected schedules have reached the census office subsequently to the period referred to.</p>
        <p>The general total of the population of the colony on the 29th March, 1857, was 410,766 ; of whom 264,334 were males, and 146,432 were females. Thus, notwithstanding the great accession to the male population caused by the influx of the Chinese, the disproportion between the sexes exhibited by the census of 1854, when there were 193 males to every 100 females, has been diminished, and the proportion is now only 180 of the former to every 100 of the latter. When, however, the Chinese and the Aborigines are excluded from the calculation, the result presented is still more satisfactory ; the disproportion falling to only 163 males to every 100 females.</p>
        <p>The change in the proportion which the population on the gold fields now bears to that of the rest of the colony deserves attention. While the increase of the gross population has been 73 per cent. since the census of 1854, the increase of the population resident within the area principally occupied by miners has been more than 113 per cent., even after deducting</p>
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-01_7"></div>
        <p>the 24,273 Chinese. It is now seen that 37 per cent. of the total population, exclusive of the Chinese, are residing on the gold fields, while in 1854 the amount was only 28 per cent. We must await the completion of the occupation returns before it can be ascertained to what extent this increase may be owing to the introduction of manufacturing and other branches of industry in the townships, but some of it must be assigned to the migration of females since 1854 ; at that period there were 371 males to every 100 females, while in 1857 there were but 281 males to every 100 females ; deducting Chinese, the proportion will be found to be reduced to 227 males to every 100 females.</p>
        <p>A very important addition made in the present census returns, as compared with those of 1854, is that which relates to the dwellings of the people. Besides the classification of the houses by the materials of which they are built, the commissioners have endeavored, by an enquiry into the number of rooms in each house, to obtain further information as to the domestic condition of the inhabitants, so far as that can be represented by the nature of their house accommodation. The mere number of inhabited houses affords of itself very little information to the statistical investigator of such questions ; and it is evident that our estimation of the material condition of the people, and of their domestic comfort, must depend greatly on the manner in which they are housed.</p>
        <p>One great fact thus ascertained is, that exclusive of Chinese and Aborigines, only 69 per cent. of the people reside in habitations that afford any approach to an adequate protection from the climate. No less than 140,892 of the population are living in tents, or in dwellings of an equally temporary nature. Of the 166,550 persons inhabiting the large area over which the gold fields extend, no less than 124,891 are dwellers in tents, three-fourths of which consist of but a single apartment.</p>
        <p>With respect to the Aborigines, their erratic mode of life obviously renders it difficult to obtain any accurate account of their number ; the returns shew this to be only 1768, of whom 40 only were to be found in the houses of Europeans, and 43 were living in tents ; indicating that these last are employed by Europeans, shepherding or in other rural occupations. The returns, however, are necessarily very imperfect, for they are mainly based on the statements of persons in charge of stations, who gave the number of natives believed to be camped on the runs at the moment ; and it is known that at the period of the census some of those who belong to this colony were engaged in an expedition towards the Darling ; while others were in the Mallee Scrub, whither it is said to be their custom at that season to repair for hunting the emu and the wild turkey.</p>
        <p>Considering the rapid rate at which immigrants are pouring into this colony, and the consequent necessity for ascertaining more frequently than in completely settled countries, the sex, age, employment, and distribution of the people over the surface of the land, I venture to express my hope, that it will be considered expedient to comply with the suggestions which have been advanced in the neighboring colonies, for a simultaneous census of the Australian people at the commencement of the year 1861 ; a period which will also coincide with that of the decennial census of the mother country and of the Crown colonies.</p>
        <p>I deem it my duty towards gentlemen who have deserved well to bring under prominent notice the zealous and indefatigable services which have been rendered in this national work by the joint secretaries, Messrs. R. B. Smyth and F. A. Corbett, the latter of whom has now been employed in the conduct of two successive censuses of the people. These gentlemen have proved themselves to be valuable public officers.</p>
        <p>In concluding my report upon the first part of the census returns, I trust I shall be held excused by my brother commissioners, if I cannot refrain from bearing record to the untiring zeal and public spirit with which they</p>
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-01_8"></div>
        <p>Have devoted so many hours and days of their valuable time to the interests of the colony, in devising and carrying out a scheme by which a great national undertaking has been happily brought to such a successful result.</p>
        <p>I have the honor to be,</p>
        <p>Sir,</p>
        <p>Your most obedient servant,</p>
        <p>NORMAN CAMPBELL,</p>
        <p>Registrar General.</p>
      
    
    <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-01_9"></div>
    
      <h1 class="appendix-title">APPENDICES TO REPORT., APPENDIX A.</h1>
      <p>Census Commission, Census Office,</p>
      <p>Melbourne, 21st January, 1857.</p>
      <p>SIR,</p>
      <p>One of the duties imposed on the Census Commissioners being the selection of suitable persons to fill the office of enumerator, I am directed to solicit your co-operation, and to request that you will recommend to the commissioners, with the least possible delay, the person in your district whom you consider most competent to discharge the duties of that position, and who is at the same time willing to undertake them.</p>
      <p>The principal business which the enumerator will have to perform, as described by the Census Bill, is as follows :—1st, to subdivide the district assigned to him into sub-districts ; 2nd, to select the number of sub-enumerators necessary for collecting those sub-districts ; 3rd, to deliver to each of those officers the requisite number of forms ; 4th, to instruct and superintend them in the performance of their duties ; 5th, to examine the schedules, ascertain that they are correctly filled, and transmit them to the office of the Registrar General ; 6th, to make out such lists and returns from the sub-enumerators' schedules as may be required ; 7th, to take such steps for the payment of the persons employed in the district as are rendered necessary by the treasury regulations.</p>
      <p>By the above statement of the duties of enumerators, you will perceive that they are of a character requiring considerable experience and intelligence, an intimate acquaintance with the residents in the various parts of the district, and a good topographical knowledge of every portion of it ; and that those nominated should occupy such a social position that persons of intelligence and respectability, &amp;c., will not be unwilling to act under them.</p>
      <p>The commissioners being desirous that the members of public bodies should aid in the supervision of the enumerators' and sub-enumerators' proceedings, and in fixing the rates of remuneration, do not consider it advisable that any member of such body should act either as enumerator or sub-enumerator within the district under his supervision. But this always supposes that the services of other equally suitable are to be procured.</p>
      <p>The commissioners propose to recommend that the sum of £ be appropriated for the gentlemen acting in the district mentioned in margin as compensation for loss of time, and for such personal expenses as he may have to incur in carrying out the Census Act.</p>
      <p>I have the honor to be, Sir,</p>
      <p>Your most obedient servant,</p>
      <p>(Signed) FRANCIS A. CORBETT,</p>
      <p>Secretary</p>
      <p>To the Chairman of</p>
      <p>&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
    
    
      <h1 class="appendix-title">APPENDIX B.</h1>
      
        <h1 class="appendix-1-title">INSTRUCTIONS FOR ENUMERATORS.</h1>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
          <p>Any person having accepted the office of enumerator, and undertaken to perform its duties, is reminded that, unless incapacitated by illness, if he declines to act, or absents himself, he is liable to punishment by fine for such default, in accordance with the provisions of the Census Act.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
          <p>The enumerator will, as soon as possible after his appointment has been notified to him, return one of the two maps of his district, which will be furnished to him for the purpose, marked by him, so as to shew the proposed subdivision of his district. He will also, at the same time, send in the names of such persons, well acquainted with the district, as are willing to undertake the duties of sub-enumerators.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
          <p>In order to place the enumerators in a position to enter into treaty with competent persons, it is hereby notified that rates of pay, within the following limits, will be sanctioned :—</p>
        
        <table border="1" summary="VIC-1857-census-01_9-1"><tbody><tr><th>To sub-enumerators, acting on horseback</th><td>£3 10s. per diem.</td></tr><tr><th>To sub-enumerators acting on foot</th><td>£2 0s. per diem.</td></tr></tbody></table>
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-01_10"></div>
        <p>Should the services of suitable persons be obtainable, and adequately remunerated at lower rates, it is the duty of the enumerators to pay a due regard to economy. If, on the other hand, these allowances should prove insufficient, authority to enter into engagements at such higher amounts as are found necessary must be applied for.</p>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
          <p>The enumerator will be careful to ascertain that the sub-enumerators understand the rate of remuneration which they are to receive.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
          <p>If from any unforeseen circumstances an enumerator should be deprived of the services of a sub-enumerator within too short a time before that appointed for taking the Census to enable him to communicate the loss, he must either act himself for the district which is thus left without a sub-enumerator or must employ the fittest person he can induce to act on so short a notice.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
          <p>The enumerator will point out on the map to the sub-enumerators the boundaries of their respective districts ; will deliver them the householders' schedules and a copy of the rules for sub-enumerators, and see that each understands how the business of sub-enumerator is to be performed. He will of course afford them every information and explanation in his power.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
          <p>The enumerator will require every person appointed to be a sub-enumerator of his district to make the following declaration :—</p>
        
        <p>" I, do hereby accept the office of sub-enumerator for the district of, and do solemnly declare that I will faithfully perform the duties of the said office to the best of my knowledge and ability.</p>
        <p>(Signed)</p>
        <p>"Taken before me</p>
        <p>the day of, 1857.</p>
        <p>, Enumerator."</p>
        <p>Warning him at the same time that he will not be at liberty, after accepting, to decline office, or avoid the performance of its duties ; and that in the event of his subsequently declining, willfully absenting himself, or neglecting his duty, he will be liable to a fine for such default, in accordance with the provisions of the Census Act.</p>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
          <p>The enumerator will send in to the office of the Registrar General, with as little delay as possible, the schedules he has received from the different sub-enumerators of his district. Before doing so, however, he will carefully examine them, and state whether, from his knowledge of the district, he believes the schedules and sub-enumerators' returns to be correct, and if otherwise his reasons for entertaining that opinion.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
          <p>The enumerator must submit the returns, but not the schedules, to the municipal council or other local body in his district, in order that it may certify to their correctness or otherwise.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>

        <h1 class="appendix-1-title">LETTER OF INSTRUCTION TO ENUMERATORS.</h1>
        <p><span class="emphasis">(Division of Census Districts.)</span></p>
        <p>Census Office,</p>
        <p>Melbourne, February, 1857.</p>
        <p>SIR,</p>
        <p>One of the most important of the duties imposed by the Census Act upon the enumerators being the subdivision of their respective districts into sub-enumerators' districts, the Census Commissioners have drawn up the following general instructions for their guidance :—</p>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
          <p>Whenever a sufficient number of persons competent to discharge the duties of sub-enumerators can be obtained, and where the features of the country admit of a minute sub-division, the enumerator must divide his district into sub-districts, each of which shall not contain a greater number of habitations than the sub-enumerator can, whether acting on foot or on horseback, complete within three days,—one being employed in distributing the schedules and two in collecting them ; and where circumstances render it impracticable to complete the collection within that time, the nearest possible approach to it must be made.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
          <p>In forming his subdivision the enumerator must take into consideration the distance to be traversed by the sub-enumerator in going from house to house, and must so arrange the sub-districts that they will comprise more houses when they lie near together, as in a town, and fewer when they lie far apart.</p>
        
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-01_11"></div>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
          <p>In the large towns, where the houses touch one another, a sub-enumerator's district may contain as many as 350 inhabited houses, but this number should in few cases be exceeded.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
          <p>In the smaller towns, villages, and suburbs of large towns, and in portions of the gold fields, where the habitations are for the most part separated from one another, the sub-districts should be so arranged as not to include more than from 150 to 250 dwellings.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
          <p>In agricultural districts, where most of the land is enclosed, but where many of the dwellings are surrounded by a large area, separating them in some cases two miles or upwards from each other, a less number than 150 houses, but seldom less than 50, may be assigned to each collector.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
          <p>In pastoral districts, and in parts of the country where there is little tillage, and where the land is for the greater part unfenced, a much less number than 50 habitations may in many cases be assigned to each sub-enumerator.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
          <p>In no case should a sub-enumerator's district form a portion of more than one county or one electoral district, or extend beyond a municipal boundary. Where a parish is fenced and the boundary is well known, it is desirable that such boundary should be adopted as the limit of a sub-district.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
          <p>A sub-enumerator's district should never consist of two or more disconnected portions of ground, but should form one connected whole, without another sub-district intervening so as to divide it.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
          <p>The limits of one sub-district should form the limits of others, and no portion of land, whether inhabited or not, belonging to an enumerator's district must be left out.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
          <p>It is necessary to select such boundaries for the sub-districts as are well marked, that they may be accurately described and easily understood, so that an intelligent collector can be at no loss to know whether he has reached the prescise limits of his district.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
          <p>Where a district is intersected by streets or fenced in roads, it is not apprehended that an enumerator can have any greater difficulty in subdividing his district than in apportioning a fair share of work to each collector (which he must be very careful in doing) ; and the exclusively pastoral districts can in many cases be taken by runs, a certain number of which may be assigned to each sub-enumerator according to the distance of the homesteads from one another. But in parts of the country where the greater portion of the lands is unfenced, and the population scattered, the utmost care will be required on the part of the enumerators ; and the commissioners wish to point out that well-known roads, creeks, swamps, and easily distinguished ranges on which there are no habitations, may be used with advantage as boundaries. As regards the gold fields, it has been suggested to the commissioners, that they cannot in very many cases be collected by gullies or hills, as it is often difficult to tell where one begins and another ends ; but as there are in most cases well-beaten cart tracks down and across them, such may be adopted in the thickly peopled districts as boundaries.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
          <p>The enumerators should always endeavor so to arrange their districts that the sub-enumerators should act entirely on foot or entirely on horseback ; bearing in mind, at the same time, that, as a general rule, mounted collectors should only be resorted to in the very thinly peopled districts, where most of the habitations are far apart.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
          <p>The commissioners wish to have it understood that a rigid adherence to all these instructions is not required, but that the enumerators are to exercise their own discretion as to their applicability.</p>
        
        <p>Signed by order of the Commissioners,</p>
        <p>FRANCIS A. CORBETT,</p>
        <p>Secretary.</p>
      
    
    
      <h1 class="appendix-title">APPENDIX D.</h1>
      
        <h1 class="appendix-1-title">RULES FOR SUB-ENUMERATORS.</h1>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
          <p>Any persons having accepted the office of sub-enumerator, and undertaken to perform its duties, is reminded that, unless incapacitated by illness, if he declines to act, absents himself, or neglects his duties, he is liable to punishment by fine for such default, in accordance with the provisions of the Census Act.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
          <p>Any person before he can act as sub-enumerator, will be required to make the following declaration :—</p>
        
        <p>"I, do hereby accept the office of sub-enumerator for the district of - , and do solemnly declare that I will faith-fully perform the duties of the said office to the best of my knowledge and ability.</p>
        <p>(Signed)</p>
        <p>"Taken before me the day of 1857. , Enumerator."</p>
        <p>Which declaration will be forwarded by the enumerator to the Registrar General.</p>
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-01_12"></div>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
          <p>The sub-enumerator will, on leaving the householder's schedule at the different houses of his district, give any information that may be required of him by the inhabitants. He must, moreover, where practicable, on the day he has left the schedule, forward to the enumerator of the district a return shewing the number of schedules he has distributed in his district.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
          <p>The sub-enumerator must, on Saturday, 28th March, leave at every house, or portion of a house separately occupied, a householder's schedule, for which schedule he must call on the Monday and Tuesday following. He must examine the schedules and see that they are properly filled in, and in the event of their not being complete, will ask for such information as will enable him to complete them. When possible he will obtain this information from the master or mistress of the house.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
          <p>The sub-enumerator will forward all the householders' schedules he has collected to the enumerator as soon as possible, and by post when practicable, taking care, in the latter case, that such packets shall be in covers, open at the ends, bear his signature, be endorsed " Census Papers, 1857," and be conformable to the Post Office Regulations as regards size and weight.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
          <p>In case of a refusal to make a written return, or to answer such questions as the sub-enumerator is authorized to put, he may remind persons so refusing of the penalty to which they are liable for that offence, and shew them the eighth clause of the Census Act having reference to it. He may also warn persons whom he suspects of willfully giving false information of the penalty for that offence.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
          <p>If a house is found locked up, and a return of the inmates of that house left with a neighbor, the house may be considered as visited.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
          <p>The sub-enumerator must not omit to enter persons on his schedule whenever he cannot obtain all the information that may be required respecting them. If, for example, he can learn no more than that a person, who has since gone away and whose name is unknown, slept in the house on the 29th March, he must set such person down in the schedule as "not known."</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
          <p>The sub-enumerators are instructed to ascertain, as nearly as possible, the number and sexes of the Aborigines who may be within their respective districts.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
          <p>The sub-enumerator will be particular in noting the number of persons, who camped out within his district on the night of the 29th March. He will enter their names, &amp;c., on his schedule, taking care previously to ascertain that they have not been already accounted for in any other sub-enumerator's district.</p>

      <p>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
      <p><span class="emphasis">This Schedule is to be filled up by the occupier or persons in charge of the house. If the house be let or sublet to different persons or families in separate stories or apartments, the occupier or person in charge of each such story or apartment must make a separate return for his portion of the house upon a separate householder's schedule.</span></p>
      <p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING UP THE COLUMN HEADED "RANK, PROFESSION, OR OCCUPATION."</p>
      <p>Magistrates, Aldermen, Town Councillors, &amp;c., to be careful to state their profession or occupation, after their official title.</p>
      <p>Army, Navy, and Civil Service.—Add, after the rank, whether in actual service, on half-pay, or retired ; and, in the latter case, if engaged in any occupation, be particular in stating it. Persons in the Civil Service to state after their title or rank the department to which they are attached, and also whether they are engaged in any other besides their official occupation.</p>
      <p>Clergymen to state the denomination of which they are ministers, and the place of worship in which they officiate. They are requested not to employ the indefinite term "clerk." Local or occasional preaches must return their ordinary occupations.</p>
      <p>Legal Profession.—Barristers to state whether or not in actual practice, and, if holding any office, to give the description. The designation "attorney" or "solicitor" to be confined to those actually upon the roll of this colony. Persons employed by barristers or in solicitors' offices should distinguish whether they are articled, writing, or other clerks, Lawyers admitted elsewhere, but not on the rolls here, to state the grade and country.</p>
      <p>Medical Profession.—Members to state whether they are physicians, surgeons, or general practitioners, and to return themselves as practicing or not practicing ; and if otherwise employed to state the occupation.</p>
      <p>Teachers, Authors, Public Writers, and Artists to state the particular branch of science, literature, or art which they cultivate. Engineers to state whether civil engineer, mechanical engineer, mining engineer, &amp;c. Surveyors to state whether land, mining, or marine surveyor.</p>
      <p>Persons engaged in trade, as Merchants, Storekeepers, Retailers, Brokers, Agents, Auctioneers, Clerks, &amp;c., to state the particular business in which they are engaged, or the staple in which they deal. The ordinary and most commonly understood terms should be employed. Commercial travelers should not omit the word "commercial."</p>
      <p>The terms Farmer and Gardener to be applied to all persons actually in occupation of land and tilling it, whether proprietors or only tenants, who should be returned "farmer or gardener of acres, employing men." The word Landowner is too vague. Proprietorship may be expressed by inserting "prop." after "farmer." Sons and daughters, brothers, or other relatives helping on farms or stations, may be returned as "son assisting," "daughter assisting," as the case may be.</p>
      <p>Gold Miners should specify whether engaged in puddling, quartz-crushing, sluicing, or alluvial sinking. Persons on the gold fields to state distinctly after their present occupation their former calling, as "gold miner, formerly physician," "storekeeper, formerly carpenter." When a gold miner employs others to assist him, he should return himself "gold miner employing men." A miner working for another should return himself as a "gold miner" not as a laborer.</p>
      <p>Artisans and Mechanics should always mention whether they are masters or journeymen, whether they keep a shop, store, &amp;c., and the number of persons in their employment. The materials on which mechanics work, and the particular branch of their trade, are always to be distinctly expressed, thus, "ship carpenter," "house carpenter," "shingler," "coach smith," "lock smith," "horse shoer." A person engaged in more than one pursuit should state his occupations in the order of their importance to himself.</p>
      <p>Carters, Carriers, Laborers, Servants, &amp;c., to describe themselves by the name of their usual employment, as " drayman on wharf," "carter to the diggings," "laborer making roads," "omnibus driver," "cabman," "porter," "messenger," &amp;c.</p>
      <p>Persons not following any profession, trade, or calling, and not holding any public office, but possessed of independent means, may designate themselves "proprietor of land," "proprietor of houses," "annuitant," as the case may be. The word "householder" should not be used in the place of proprietor of houses, nor the word "gentleman" or "lady" in place of "no occupation." Persons who have ceased to follow one pursuit, and have not commenced another, should enter "no occupation at present."</p>
      
        <h3 class="paragraph-title">Women.—</h3>
        <p>The occupations of women not coming under the foregoing instructions, and who are employed in any but domestic duties, should be distinctly recorded, but they should not be entered as engaged in the occupations of their husbands or fathers, &amp;c., unless they regularly assist them. When only in the capacity of wife, mother, daughter, sister, &amp;c., write "domestic duties."</p>
      
      
        <h3 class="paragraph-title">Children.—</h3>
        <p>If children are regularly pursuing or assisting in any occupation, it should be stated ; if daily attending a national, denominational, or private school, or receiving tuition under a master or governess at home, it should be specified by writing against the names "attending national school," "attending denominational school," "attending private school," "scholar at home," as the case may be. When only in the relation of son, daughter, or other relative, write "domestic duties," as in the case of women.</p>
      
      
        <h3 class="paragraph-title">Persons in Hospitals, Asylums, Gaols, &amp;c.—</h3>
        <p>Care should be taken to describe their position as inmates, in addition to the insertion of their previous occupations, thus, "prisoner," "patient," "gaoler," "nurse."</p>
      
      <p>The occupation which each person is actually following and deriving income from at the time of the census should in all cases be stated.</p>
      <p>Every answer should be written in full. The use of dots (,,) or ditto (do.) leads to numerous mistakes, and cannot be received by the sub-enumerator.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">REPORT</h1>
        <p>Registrar General's Office,</p>
        <p>Melbourne, 6th May, 1858.</p>
        <p>SIR,</p>
        <p>In submitting the accompanying return of the " Occupations of the People," according to the census taken on the 29th day of March, 1857, it is necessary that I should premise that the classification adopted in the last census returns of Great Britain has been adhered to as closely as circumstances would permit, having due regard to results of practical utility.</p>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
          <p>For although it is unquestionably desirable that the population statistics of every portion of the British Empire should be compiled upon a uniform system, there are many branches of industry in the mother country, which have either not yet been introduced into this colony, or have been pursued but to a very limited extent. Any very close adherence to the sub-divisions observed in the English returns would, therefore, become inexpedient.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
          <p>While those returns have, accordingly, been adopted as the standard of uniformity, their arrangement has been occasionally modified in such a manner as to admit of future useful comparison, and if necessary, of expansion. With this view, it will be seen that in some instances, it has been considered advisable to include under a single sub-class a number of cognate sub-divisions, which are separately distinguished in the English tables. The occupations having been similarly grouped, and a general uniformity of principle observed, it will be easy hereafter to introduce more minute sub-divisions without rendering a comparison with the present classification difficult or obscure.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
          <p>In order to elucidate the principle which has regulated these minor modifications, it may be stated, that while in the census returns of 1854, prepared also in conformity with those of Great Britain, no sub-division was made in class 1,—namely, that of " Persons engaged in the general or local Government and defence of the Country ;" the greater accuracy of the recent census, and the extensive introduction of Municipal Institutions, suggested the propriety of sub-dividing this class in such a manner as to convey a more clear idea of the nature of the employment of the individuals comprised under the general denomination.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
          <p>In like manner the great revolution which has taken place in the mode of carrying on mining operations on the gold-fields, rendered it desirable to prepare an analysis of this numerous section of the industrial population, such as could have had no foundation in the year 1854.</p>

          <p>The introduction of quartz-crushing, and the general use of puddling machines, of whims, sluices, and other mechanical appliances in the art of gold mining, early attracted the attention of the late census commission ; and I have deemed it my duty to carry out the judicious design of my coadjutors on that board, by endeavoring to present as accurate a view as possible of the manner in which this vast accumulation of human labor and mechanical skill has been applied and distributed.</p>
        
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-02_4"></div>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
          <p>If the information thus afforded be not so precise as could be desired regarding the extent to which improvements have been introduced, sufficient is apparent on the surface to enable us to form a just conception of the great advance which has been made in the application of mechanical aids, requiring the association of individuals and the combination of their capital. It will accordingly be seen that not less than one-seventh of the whole mining population have learned to appreciate the value of the assistance which can be afforded by science and the combination of labor.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
          <p>Excluding the Chinese element, which had not attained much importance at the period of the previous census, the relative proportion which the number of men occupied in raising gold bears to the total of the male population of the colony has varied less than might have been anticipated. In 1854 they numbered 36,332, being 2,331 out of every 10,000 of the male inhabitants of the colony. In 1857 they amounted to 62,211 (See Table II.), being in the proportion of 2,616 to every 10,000 of the males. When the previous census was taken, it was found that 6,389 of every 10,000 of the population residing on the gold-fields were actually engaged in mining,—a proportion which on the recent occasion had fallen to 5,743 in every 10,000 ; showing that while the miners now comprise a larger proportion of the total male population of the colony, their comparative relation to the number of male residents on the gold-fields has fallen considerably.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
          <p>Contrasting the figures presented in the accompanying returns with those of the previous census, it will be observed, that while the population of the colony, exclusive of Chinese and Aborigines, has increased 62 per cent., the addition to the important class engaged in commerce, trade and manufactures, has been but 32 per cent. The increase in the numbers employed in mining, and in grazing and agricultural pursuits, has been respectively 71 and 168 per cent. To render this branch of the inquiry more clear, it may be as well to remark that, out of a population of 383,668 persons, the net result, after deducting the Chinese and Aborigines not in the employment of the other colonists, 69,258 were engaged in commerce, trade, and manufactures, and 38,625 in agricultural and pastoral pursuits.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
          <p>The high proportion which the trading class bore to the general population in the year 1854, compared with their position in 1857, would suggest the idea that at the former period they were more numerous than were required by the wants of the colony. From whatever cause it may have arisen, certain it is that while in 1854, out of every 10,000 males, 747 belonged to this class, the proportion in 1857 was only 479 to every 10,000.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
          <p>In the seaport towns they have receded from 1,377 to 880 in every 10,000 of the males,—the absolute decrease being 2,265, or from 8,345 to 6,080, a reduction of 37 per cent., notwithstanding the augmented population of those towns. A reference to the tables which exhibit the Occupations of the People on the gold-fields will, to some extent, explain this altered condition, for it will be observed that much of the trade which, in 1854, might be said to be almost confined to Melbourne and Geelong, has shifted to the centres of population which have arisen in the interior, and that the proportion has risen in those districts from 266 to 409 in every 10,000. The Chinese have not been taken into consideration in this calculation.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
          <p>With respect to the large increase which will be noticed in the agricultural class, it appears that while the number of squatters, sheep-farmers, and graziers has continued nearly stationary, the cultivators (males) have increased from 3,219 to 7,960, or 147 per cent. ; and farm laborers from 4,294 to 14,860, or 246 per cent.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
          <p>The male population on the gold-fields engaged in the cultivation</p>
        
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-02_5"></div>
        <p>of the soil has risen from 139 to 280 in the 10,000. Although there is a high rate of increase in the absolute number employed in tillage (1,893) within the area embraced in the returns for the mining districts, it is still very small, considering the great extent of country over which it is spread. It must be remembered, however, that it is only of late years that the sale of public lands in those districts has commenced ; and, moreover, that in many instances land supposed to be auriferous has been reserved for mining purposes.</p>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
          <p>A noticeable fact presented in these returns, is the great increase of farm laborers as compared with that of their employers, and which may in all probability be principally ascribed to the fall which has taken place in wages ; a fall which, while it has enabled the farmer to employ more hands, has at the same time diminished the laborer's means of becoming a proprietor of land, or even a tenant farmer. In 1854 there were only 133 farm servants to every 100 cultivators ; in 1857 these proportions had increased to 185 for every 100 cultivators.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">15.</h3>
          <p>A share in the augmentation which will be observed in the number of females engaged in agricultural pursuits, as compared with that shown in the previous returns, must be attributed to the greater degree of accuracy with which the householders' schedules have been filled up at the recent census. Vagueness in this respect in 1854 necessarily led to a great many of the females regularly employed in the dairy, the field, or the farm-yard, being classed amongst those engaged merely in domestic duties. On this occasion the wives and daughters of farmers, and of laborers who are ordinarily accustomed to assist in farming-work have been returned accordingly ; but independently of the apparent increase arising from this cause, there has undoubtedly been a large addition to the number of farmers' wives, as well as of females and of married couples engaged on farms and stations.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
          <p>The manufacturing class exhibits an increase in the mining districts in the proportion of from 438 to 571 in every 10,000 males, and a decrease in the seaport towns of from 1983 to 1362 in every 10,000. There is also a slight relative decrease in the number of artisans in the rural districts. The actual number of persons engaged in art and mechanical productions was found to be 13,622 in the seaport towns, 5,714 on the gold-fields, and 9,322 in the rural districts ; this does not include those employed in the higher branches, such as architects, surveyors, and civil engineers.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">17.</h3>
          <p>Persons trading in the necessaries of life, such as butchers, bakers, greengrocers, brewers, mineral water manufacturers, and others, have increased from 140 to 338 in every 10,000.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
          <p>The subject of " Education of the People" will form a distinct branch of this series of census returns ; but it may be interesting to note for the present, that the total number of children returned as scholars, whether in public or private schools, or at home, was 34,476 ; of whom 17,346 were males, and 17,130 females.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
          <p>Notwithstanding that so large a proportion of our increased population is now permanently settled in the interior, and that much greater facilities also exist for traveling, it is remarkable that those engaged in the inland traffic, and carrying class in towns, bear very nearly the same proportion as before—having been in 1854, 382 out of every 10,000 of the population, and in 1857, 389 to the 10,000. The growth of many of the more bulky articles of produce near to markets in the interior of the colony, must no doubt, have exercised considerable influence on the carrying trade from the seaports.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">20.</h3>
          <p>Beyond a doubt the expense of administering the Government of a sparsely peopled country, should naturally bear a reduced relative proportion to the numbers of the community, as population becomes more</p>
        
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-02_6"></div>
        <p>densely settled, and thus the reduction which has taken place since the year 1854, in the proportionate number of persons embraced in the first class of these returns—namely, "Those employed in the general and local Government and defence of the country," notwithstanding an increase of 73 per cent. in the population of the colony, and the extension of municipal and other local institutions, is a fact which must prove acceptable to the general public, who have to bear the burthen of taxation.</p>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">21.</h3>
          <p>As regards the learned professions and their immediate subordinates, the only noticeable circumstance is to be found in the fact of the number of practicing physicians and surgeons having fallen from 22 to 14 for every 10,000 persons. The clergy, ministers, missionaries, and scripture readers, continue to hold nearly the same proportion as before, being at present a little more than 6 to every 10,000 inhabitants, exclusive of the Chinese.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">22.</h3>
          <p>There remains but to notice the class consisting of persons maintained at the public cost, and the change which has taken place in the number of these is highly satisfactory. The actual increase in number of prisoners in confinement has been from 1,713 in the year 1854 to 2,038 in the year 1857. The population, however, having in the interval increased from 236,798 to a gross total of 410,766, it follows that the proportion has fallen from 72 to 49 in every 10,000 of the inhabitants, the diminution having taken place in the males, being from 104 to 70 in 10,000 of that sex ; the female prisoners amount to one in 10,000 more than in 1854. These results are the more gratifying when it is considered that the improved organization of our police force has rendered the detection and apprehension of criminals much more certain than it was.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">23.</h3>
          <p>In the sub-division of this class which refers to the inmates of hospitals, asylums, depots, &amp;c., there is not only a relative, but an actual decrease ; and it is a matter of much gratification to find that the number of persons supported by the industry of others has fallen from 53 to 28 in every 10,000 of the people.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">24.</h3>
          <p>In matters of legislation and of police arrangements, the Chinese have, it is well known, proved a source of perplexity and embarrassment ; and the existence of this exotic element in the population of the colony has in like manner not failed to produce some degree of difficulty in the region of statistical inquiry.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">25.</h3>
          <p>When treating of the actual condition and social relations of the permanent and genuine body of the colonists, it is evident that, if it be intended to present a truthful picture of our colonial society, we must in many cases exclude the natives of the " flowery land" from consideration. For, notwithstanding that it has been stated on high authority in Parliament that they have, by applying formally for " Letters of Naturalization," contrived to escape the special imposts laid upon then by the Legislature, I find by reference to the records of the registry of the Supreme Court, that from the 1st January, 1857, to the present time, only seven Chinamen have actually taken the oaths of allegiance. Proverbial as they are for sobriety and patient industry, they may, perhaps, be termed from their habits, the gleaners in our field of industry ; but their national characteristic of cunning would appear to have displayed itself in this instance, by their taking no further steps to complete their naturalization and enroll their certificates. This skilful artifice may, however, be easily counteracted by the authorities, since the grant of a certificate of naturalization becomes lapsed if the oaths of allegiance are not taken before one of the Judges of the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of issue, and the parties thus again, by default, become liable to the evaded impost.</p>
        
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">26.</h3>
          <p>But while it has been necessary to exercise discrimination with respect to these people when treating of social questions, wherein it was desirable to arrive at just conclusions respecting the real condition of the</p>
        
        <div class="page-break" id="VIC-1857-census-02_7"></div>
        <p>colony, it is obvious that the presence of the Chinese must necessarily be taken into consideration in all questions relating to trade, consumption of dutiable articles, and revenue from the export duty on gold. In inquiries upon such subjects the existence of 25,000 Chinese males amongst out population cannot be ignored.</p>
        
          <h3 class="paragraph-title">27.</h3>
          <p>I am sensible that these considerations are, to some extent, applicable to the natives of other foreign states residing amongst us ; but as many of these have become naturalized and actual proprietors of land, thereby indicating an intention of becoming colonists in the true sense of the term, it has become impossible to place them in the same category with the Chinese.</p>

      <p>REPORT.</p>
      <p>Registrar-General's Office,</p>
      <p>Melbourne, 16th November, 1858.</p>
      <p>SIR,</p>
      
        <h3 class="paragraph-title">1</h3>
        <p>I have the honor to inform you that the whole of the Population Returns, authorised by the Government to be compiled in this Department, from the Schedules collected on the 29th March, 1857, under the Census Act (20 Vict., No. 2), are at length completed.</p>
      
      
        <h3 class="paragraph-title">2. Two of these Returns, viz:—</h3>
        <p>(I.) INHABITANTS AND HOUSES, and (II.) OCCUPATIONS OF THE PEOPLE, have been already laid before Parliament. Those now submitted relate to (III.) THE AGE ; (IV.) THE EDUCATION ; (V.) THE CIVIL OR CONJUGAL CONDITION ; (VI.) THE BIRTH-PLACE ; and (VII.) THE RELIGION OF THE PEOPLE.</p>
      
      
        <h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
        <p>The task of tabulating the present Census has been both long and arduous ; and I feel pleasure in testifying to the zeal and assiduity of the gentlemen employed thereon, and in making special reference to the efficient superintendence of Mr. Corbett, one of the Secretaries attached to the late Census Commission.</p>
      
      
        <h3 class="paragraph-title">4</h3>
        <p>The tabular results of the various Censuses taken in this country have a permanent value, and extensive application will be made of them in the Registrar-General's future Statistical Reports.</p>
      
      <p>I have the honor to be,</p>
      <p>Sir,</p>
      <p>Your very obedient Servant,</p>
      <p>WILLIAM HENRY ARCHER.</p>

      <p>NOTE.—There is reason to believe that several of those persons of advanced age who appear on the returns as unmarried, are really widowers. Some instances were noticed on the Schedules of "Unmarried" being entered opposite the name of very old men residing with their children and grand-children. The Collectors, probably, being informed that they had not wives, carelessly entered them as unmarried.</p>

      <p>NOTE.—The estimate for the Migratory Population of the Gold Fields, which is formed on the complete returns for the Gold Fields, varies from that for the entire Colony, which has been based on the gross population. The Schedules of the Mining Districts being less carefully filled than those of the more settled population, and a greater use made of general terms—such as "Protestant," "Catholic," "Presbyterian,"—the estimate for the entire Colony may be taken as the more correct, and as rectifying the incompleteness of the Gold Fields' Returns.</p>
