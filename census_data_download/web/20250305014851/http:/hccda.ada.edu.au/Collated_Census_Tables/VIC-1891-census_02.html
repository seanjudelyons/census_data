		<h1 class="chapter-title">CENSUS OF VICTORIA, 1891., GENERAL REPORT.</h1>
		<p><span class="emphasis">To the Honorable the Chief Secretary.</span></p>
		<p>Office of the Government Statist,</p>
		<p>Melbourne, 27th January, 1893.</p>
		<p>SIR,</p>
		<p>The Census returns having been compiled and printed, I do myself the honour to submit the following Report thereon :—</p>
		
			<h1 class="section-title">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
				<p>The Census of Victoria 1891, as well as that of all the other Australasian Colonies, was taken as referring to midnight on Sunday, the 5th April of that year, which time coincided with that appointed for enumerating the population of the United Kingdom and most of the outlying portions of Her Majesty's Dominions.
						<span class="annotation"> [Introductory remarks.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>The subject of the Census of the British Empire was considered incidentally at the Colonial Conference held in London, in April, 1887, under the presidency of the Right Honorable the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir Henry Holland (now Lord Knutsford). It was then stated that in the month of July, 1886, the Registrar-General of Ireland had called attention to the want of information on the subject of Census statistics, and had made proposals for a simultaneous Census of the Empire under the direction of representatives of the United Kingdom, India, and the Colonies ; also that the Royal Colonial Institute and the Imperial Federation League had made representations to the Colonial Office upon the same subject. It was further mentioned that the Registrar-General of England had reported generally against these proposals, and had expressed himself "distinctly of opinion that it is best to leave each individual part of the Empire the choice of subjects of inquiry that should be included in its Census, and the form in which the information, when collected, can best be tabulated, so as to meet its own special conditions and requirements."
						<span class="annotation"> [Colonial Conference in London.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>The matter was discussed by the members of the Conference referred to, an officer of the General Register Office, London, being in attendance to give information thereon. No decision was arrived at, but the general feeling appeared to be that the Census of the whole British Empire should be taken at a given date, and that</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_2"></div>
			<p>uniformity of treatment should be secured where possible, which could be best obtained by the transmission of suggestions from the Imperial Government to the Colonial Governments two years before the date at which such Census should be taken.<div class="footnote">* 
					<p>See<span class="emphasis">Proceedings of the Colonial Conference</span>1887, Volume 1., page 552 et seq., and Volume II., page 156 et seq. Eyre and Spottiswoode London, 1887.</p>
				</div></p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>In pursuance of the outcome of this discussion, Lord Knutsford communicated with the Registrar-General of England, and requested that consideration might be given to the expediency of issuing proposals upon the subject, with the view of their being transmitted to the colonies at an early date.
						<span class="annotation"> [Suggestions by Registrar-General of England.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>To this communication the Registrar-General replied to the effect that no Census Act having been passed up to that time (January, 1889), he was unable to state positively what the subjects of inquiry would be, but, supposing them to be identical with those in 1881, he recommended the adoption of the same inquiries and the same forms as were then used in the taking and compilation of the English Census. He also made some suggestions as to what the age divisions should be, so as to harmonize with the divisions it was proposed to adopt in England.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
				<p>A copy of the Registrar-General's letter was forwarded to the Governors of the respective colonies, under cover of a circular dispatch, dated 28th February, 1889, in which Lord Knutsford commenced for consideration the points enumerated by the Registrar-General, and desired to be informed if they met with the concurrence of the Colonial Governments. The correspondence having been referred to me for report, I pointed out that the heads of inquiry indicated had been embodied in the schedule used at the last four Censuses of this colony, and, in addition, inquiries had been made here as to the amount of primary instruction possessed by, and religious belief of, each inhabitant of the colony ; also the number of rooms in, and the materials of, the house in which each family dwelt ; and further that, in tabulating the returns, the English system had been followed as closely as local circumstances would permit, somewhat less detail being given here than there under the head of occupations, but considerably more under several of the other heads ; also that prior to the compilation of the Census returns it was proposed to thoroughly revise the tabulation forms, with the view of making the classification agree, if possible, still more closely with that of England and Wales.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>A paper on the subject of the then ensuing Census was read on the 8th January, 1890, by the present writer, before Section F of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, which was, at the time, assembled in Melbourne. In this paper the author laid stress upon the desirability of giving an Imperial character to the returns by compiling them, as nearly as possible, upon the English model, such divergencies only being allowed as might be necessary to suit local circumstances. He also strongly urged that, before the time came for taking the Census, the heads of the statistical departments of the different colonies should meet in conference, with the view of an agreement being arrived at for a uniform system of compilation throughout the group.
						<span class="annotation"> [Conference of Australasian Colonies on subject of Census.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
				<p>The idea of a Census Conference at once met with the approval of the members of the section, and the matter was soon afterwards brought to the notice of</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_3"></div>
			<p>the Government of Tasmania by Mr. R. M. Johnston, the Government Statistician of that colony, who had been President of Section F, as well as by the present writer, the result being that, after some correspondence between the Governments of the different colonies, it was at length decided that such a conference should be held at Hobart in the month of March, 1890.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
				<p>The Conference was accordingly held, the colonies represented being Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. Queensland, Western Australia, and Fiji did not send representatives, but expressed themselves generally as willing to fall in with the arrangements recommended by the Conference so far as circumstances might allow.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
				<p>The present writer was unanimously elected President of the Conference. The first meeting was held on the 3rd March, 1890, and the sittings were continued daily until the 18th of the same month, the result being that the principles on which the householder's schedule should be framed were agreed upon, and a model schedule based thereon was drawn up and adopted ; forms for classifying the Census returns under the several heads of inquiry—keeping in view Lord Knutsford's dispatch of the 28th February, 1889, and the letter of the Registrar-General of England attached thereto—were also decided upon ; and many minor points calculated to promote uniformity in the tabular statements published in the different colonies were discussed and settled.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
				<p>A Bill for taking a Census of the population and live stock of Victoria was introduced by the Government, and became law on the 15th September, 1890, under the title of the<span class="emphasis">Census Act</span>1891.<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>54 Vict. No. 1171.</p>
					</div>This measure fixed the day on which the enumeration was to be made, gave the Governor in Council power to appoint the requisite officers, roughly defined the process to be pursued, and made the Government Statist—under the Minister—the officer responsible for giving effect to the provisions of the Act.
						<span class="annotation"> [Census Act.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
				<p>On former occasions in Victoria, the householder's schedule was attached to, and formed portion of, the Census Act, but the undesirability of this having been pointed out by the Government Statist in his report upon the Census of 1881 ;<div class="footnote">† 
						<p>" Much evil has been found to result from the householder's schedule being attached to the Census Act. I would recommend that, in future, only the heads of inquiry should be embodied in the Act, on which a schedule should afterwards be based. There are matters of detail in this schedule which it is often desirable to vary even at the last moment, and this could be done if the schedule were, within certain limits, merely a matter of regulation ; whereas, hitherto, the Act once passed, however desirable it might be to effect changes, it has been impossible to alter the form of the schedule in the slightest degree." —See Report on the Census of Victoria, 1881, by H. H. Hayter, C.M.G., paragraph 3. Ferres, Melbourne, 1883.</p>
					</div>and the Census Conference above alluded to, over which the same officer presided in Hobart, having also reported against the practice;<div class="footnote">‡ 
						<p>" In view of the possibility of its being found desirable to make alterations in the wording of the schedule after the Census Act has been passed, we have unanimously resolved to recommend that only the heads of inquiry—not the schedule—be embodied in the Census Act."—See Report of the Conference of Statists, paragraph 3. Strutt, Hobart, 1890.</p>
					</div>the heads of inquiry only were embodied in the<span class="emphasis">Census Act</span>1891, it being provided that the schedule embracing these heads should be prepared independently, subject to the approval of the Minister.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
				<p>The subjects of inquiry prescribed under the Census Act, and eventually arranged in the householder's schedule according to the pattern agreed upon at the</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_4"></div>
			<p>Census Conference, were identical with those adopted at former Censuses in this colony. They are specified in the third section of the Act, and are as follow<div class="footnote">*

				<p>It being thought desirable, "for the purpose of giving better effect to the laws relating to education," that the machinery of the Census should be made use of for the purpose of ascertaining what children were and were not being educated, a form of educational schedule was attached to the Census Act, in which provision was made for obtaining information as to the name, sex, and place of residence of every child under fifteen years of age, also whether it was receiving education, and, if so, at what place. As this was done merely for the information of the Education Department, the schedules, when collected, were at once passed on to that Department, to be dealt with as the Minister of Public Instruction might think fit.</p>

				<p>The first permanent settlement of Victoria (then the Port Phillip district of New South Wales) was by John Batman, who arrived on the 29th May, 1835, and was shortly after followed by John Pascoc Fawkner.<div class="footnote">† 
						<p>Mr. Edward Henty had established a station on Portland Bay in the previous November, but this can hardly be said to have led to the permanent settlement of the colony, which was due to the enterprise of the parties led by Batman and Fawkner.</p>
					</div>A year after the arrival of Batman an officer from Sydney, Mr. George Stewart, was sent by Sir Richard Bourke, the then Governor of New South Wales, to report upon the newly settled district. He found that on the 25th May, 1836, the population, exclusive of Aborigines—of whose numbers no estimate was made—consisted of 177 persons, viz., 142 males and 35 females. On the 29th September of the same year Captain Lonsdale arrived from Sydney to take charge of the district in the capacity of Resident Magistrate. He caused the population to be counted on the 8th November, when it was found to number 224, viz., 186 males and 38 females. Soon after, a stream of immigration having set in, chiefly from New South Wales and Tasmania, it was decided to take a Census on the 12th September, 1838, as a result of which the population was found to number 3,511, viz., 3,080 males and 431 females. The fourth enumeration was made on the 2nd March, 1841, that being the day on which the Census of the United Kingdom was also taken, the population returned being 11,738, viz., 8,274 males and 3,464 females. After this it was intended to take the Census quinquennially, and accordingly an enumeration was made on the 2nd March, 1846, resulting in a total of 32,879, viz.,

			<p>20, 184 males and 12,695 females, and again on the 2nd March, 1851, resulting in a total of 77,345, viz., 46,202 males and 31,143 females. The district was now separated from New South Wales and erected into an independent colony, and the first goldfields had been discovered. Chiefly in consequence of the latter event a large accession of population took place, and it was determined not to wait until the next quinquennial period, but to enumerate the population on the 26th April, 1854. This was accordingly done, the population returned being 236,798, viz., 155,887 males and 80,911 females. The fame of the Victorian gold-fields continuing to cause an influx of population, another Census was taken after an interval of three years, viz., on the 29th March, 1857, the total number returned being 410,766, viz., 264,334 males and 146,432 females. Since then the population has been enumerated decennially on the same day as that on which the Census of the United Kingdom has been taken, viz., on the 7th April, 1861, population 540,322, viz., 328,651 males and 211,671 females ; 2nd April, 1871, population 731,528, viz., 401,050 males and 330,478 females ; 3rd April, 1881, population 862,346, viz., 452,083 males and 410,263 females ; and 5th April, 1891 (the Census which forms the subject of this Report), population 1,140,405, viz., 598,414 males and 541,991 females.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
				<p>In 1881 and 1891 all the colonies of the Australasian group enumerated their population on the same day. In 1861 and 1871 the Census was only simultaneous in the case of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. In the last-named year Queensland did not take her Census until the 1st September, or five months later than the three colonies mentioned ; whilst Western Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand had already taken their Censuses, the first on the 31st March, 1870, the second on the 7th February, 1870, and the third on the 27th February, 1871.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">17.</h3>
				<p>It may be remarked that all the Australasian Colonies now take their Census decennially, on the same day as the Census is taken in the United Kingdom ; but Queensland and New Zealand also take an intermediate Census, thereby securing a quinquennial enumeration of their respective populations.</p>
			
		
		
			<h1 class="section-title">ARRANGEMENTS FOR TAKING THE CENSUS.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
				<p>The<span class="emphasis">Census Act</span>1891 provided for the appointment by the Governor in Council of two classes of officers for the purpose of taking the Census, viz., enumerators who should have charge of districts the limits of which the Governor in Council should define, and sub-enumerators who should perform the work of house to house collection in subdivisions of the enumerators' districts (sub-districts). Practically the formation of the enumerators' districts and the selection of the enumerators rested with the Government Statist, whilst the formation of the sub-districts and the selection of the sub-enumerators rested with the enumerators.
						<span class="annotation"> [Arrangements for taking the Census.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
				<p>The existing subdivisions of the colony of Victoria are numerous. Amongst these there are counties, electoral districts, electoral provinces, municipalities, police, mining, and deputy registrars' districts, parishes and bailiwicks, as well as various other divisions. In forming these divisions, which has been done at different times, but little attempt appears to have been made to assimilate the boundaries of the various classes of districts or to fit them in with each other ; but as it was necessary to find the Census population of each of the individual districts contained in these classes it became a matter of importance to decide which class should be taken as the
						<span class="annotation"> [Formation of Census districts] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_8"></div>
			<p>basis of the enumerators' districts, so that after the schedules were received by the Government Statist the difficulty of combining and arranging them in order to effect that object might be reduced as much as possible. After much consideration I determined upon taking the electoral districts for such basis. These had the advantage of frequently coinciding as regards some of their boundaries with the electoral provinces and municipal districts ; they were, moreover, generally of a suitable size to intrust to the charge of individual enumerators, and as most persons know in what district they vote at parliamentary elections, their boundaries were well recognized and easily discoverable upon the ground.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">20.</h3>
				<p>There are 84 electoral districts. Of these, 79 were assigned to single enumerators ; but, in consequence of the large population, extent, or scattered nature of the other five electorates, I deemed it prudent to subdivide them, viz.,:—Castlemaine, East Bourke Boroughs, Gippsland East, and Villiers and Heytesbury each into two and Donald and Swan Hill into three enumerators' districts. The total number of Census districts was thus 90.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">21.</h3>
				<p>The enumerators were not required to take account of the population living in ships (except those engaged in inland navigation) or in the islands on the coast (except those situated in Westernport Bay) or in light-houses. The inhabitants of ships lying in the Port of Melbourne were enumerated under the direction of the Harbor-master to the Melbourne Harbor Trust, whilst those of ships lying in other ports and places, and of islands and light-houses were enumerated by officers of the Customs Department. A special schedule was provided for the purpose of enumerating the persons in ships.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">22.</h3>
				<p>As soon as it became known that the districts were decided upon, and that enumerators would be required, many applications were received from persons desirous of filling the office. These were carefully considered by the Government Statist before making his recommendation to the Minister. When no applicant appeared to be suitable, or if doubt existed as to which one was most suitable, the member for the district was consulted. No one was recommended for appointment who was not a resident of the district for which he applied.
						<span class="annotation"> [Appointment of enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">23.</h3>
				<p>The enumerators were appointed early in January of the Census year, and thus had three months in which to make their preparations. As soon as the appointments were made, each enumerator was supplied with printed instructions respecting the nature of his duties, and was, moreover, furnished with two maps of his district whereon to mark his proposed plan of subdivision, also with two sets of forms having spaces on which to enter the boundaries and size of each sub-district, the number of dwellings it contained, the length of time proposed to be allowed for delivering and collecting the schedules, the names of the persons recommended for appointment as sub-enumerators, and whether it was proposed they should act on foot or on horse-back. The enumerator was instructed that after he had marked the maps and entered the required particulars on the forms, he should keep one set for his own guidance and return the other to the Government Statist in order that judgment might be formed as to the propriety of his arrangements.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">24.</h3>
				<p>The instruction to the enumerators with reference to laying out their districts was to the effect that in all cities, towns, and boroughs, and where possible also in shires, the country should be so divided that the work of enumeration might
						<span class="annotation"> [Subdivision of Census districts.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_9"></div>
			<p>be completed in three days, viz., one day for delivering and two days for collecting the schedules, but that whilst in scattered country districts more time might be allowed, an endeavour should be made to complete the collection by the Saturday following the Sunday of the Census. To effect these objects it was pointed out that in apportioning the work, it would be necessary to consider the distance to be traversed by the sub-enumerator in going from dwelling to dwelling, and so to form the sub-districts as to embrace more dwellings when these were situated near together, and fewer when they were apart. The following scale, which was that used at the Census of 1881 and found to answer well on that occasion, was recommended for adoption:—</p>
			<table border="1" summary="VIC-1891-census_02-15_9-1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Inhabited houses to be included in a sub-district.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>In towns where the houses adjoin or are only a few yards apart</th><td>150 to 200</td></tr><tr><th>In suburban districts or on gold-fields where the dwellings are still near, although further apart than in a closely-built town</th><td>100 to 150</td></tr><tr><th>In the more settled agricultural districts where there is occasionalally a distance of more than half-a-mile between one dwelling and the next nearest</th><td>50 to 100</td></tr><tr><th>In the more scattered agricultural districts where intervals of two miles or upwars intervence between some dwellings and others</th><td>Less than 50</td></tr><tr><th>In scattered country and pastoral districts, or for enumerating small bodies of miners prospecting, or men engaged in splitting timber, &amp;c.</th><td>According to the circumstances of the locality.</td></tr></tbody></table>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">25.</h3>
				<p>Some of the enumerators divided their districts according to this scale in the first instance, and in other respects made their arrangements in so satisfactory a manner that their scheme could be at once approved of, but this was exceptional. The tendency of the majority was to make the sub-districts too large, and although the instruction was definite to so subdivide that not more than 200 houses should be assigned to any sub-enumerator, and as many as that only in a closely-built town, some of the enumerators, even in scattered country districts, where the houses were half a mile or more apart, allotted as many as 300 and even 400 houses to a sub-enumerator. Of course, in these cases the papers were returned for amendment, and this, in some instances, had to be done several times before approval could be accorded. It may be remarked that a disposition to make the sub-districts unduly large has been observed at every Census, and this has been a cause of constant contention and much correspondence between the Government Statist and the enumerators. Probably the chief cause of this tendency is that the enumerators desire to save themselves the trouble that a more minute subdivision of their district would entail, but also, in some instances, with the object of giving the sub-enumerators as many days' work and, consequently, as much pay as possible. As the sub-enumerators are frequently selected from amongst the relatives, neighbours, and acquaintances of the enumerator, that is, perhaps, not unnatural ; but it is, nevertheless, a practice which it is necessary that the department with which the management of the Census rests should watch closely and keep in check.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">26.</h3>
				<p>For the guidance of the sub-enumerators, each one was supplied, on appointment, with printed instructions, in which the nature of his duties were fully detailed. Moreover, in country districts, as well as in town districts when deemed necessary, the sub-enumerators were supplied with maps showing the boundaries of their sub-districts, also those of any places situated therein it was desired should be shown separately.
						<span class="annotation"> [Maps and instructions.] </span>

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_10"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">27.</h3>
				<p>It had been the practice at previous Censuses to inform each sub-enumerator on his engagement of the number of days he would be allowed for completing his work, in determining which the nature and extent of his district were carefully weighed and taken into account. As, however, it was considered that it might not always be possible to judge beforehand of the exact time the work of a sub-district ought to occupy, he was further told that should the time allotted prove insufficient the enumerator's recommendation for additional payment would be considered. This arrangement was found to work badly, its effect being that on each occasion a majority of the sub-enumerators professed themselves unable to finish in the allotted time and claimed more pay, the consequence being that much correspondence ensued, and much time was wasted before all the claims could be satisfactorily settled. To avoid similar trouble at the Census under notice, I caused forms of agreement to be printed in duplicate, one copy to be retained by the enumerator and the other by the sub-enumerator, in which the number of days allowed were entered, also the rate of payment per day, and whether the work was to be done on foot or on horseback. These documents were signed by the enumerator and sub-enumerator, the latter being distinctly told that so far as payment was concerned he would be bound by the time set down, whether he could do the work within that time or not. This gave the enumerators rather more trouble in engaging the men, but it resulted in great saving of time and work to the department. In cases where, after the Census had been taken, it was found that the amount of work in a sub-district had been much underrated by the enumerator, or unexpected difficulties had arisen, some concession was necessarily made, but these cases being few in number, it was found possible to pay a large proportion of the sub-enumerators within a fortnight, and nearly all within a month, of the taking of the Census. On former occasions, for the reasons stated, four or five months were occupied in making an equal amount of progress.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">28.</h3>
				<p>The enumerators were paid by a single sum according to the amount of work in their districts. These payments were fixed by the Government Statist, subject to the approval of the Minister. For town districts they generally ranged from £20 to £25, and for country districts from £25 to £70. After the Census had been taken it was found that in some cases the payment had been fixed too low, and it was therefore raised. The total amount ultimately paid to the 90 enumerators was £2,713, or an average of £30 2s. 11d. to each. The largest payment to any enumerator was £70, and the smallest £20.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">29.</h3>
				<p>The number of sub-enumerators employed was 2,330, of whom 976 acted on foot, 1,310 on horseback, and 44 partly on foot and partly on horseback, and besides there were 45 interpreters to the Chinese, who were treated in all respect as sub-enumerators ; there were thus 2,375 persons engaged in the actual work of house to house collection. The total number of days these officers worked was 12,818, of which 9,188 were paid for at the horseback and 3,721 at the foot rate. The longest time any sub-enumerator worked was 20 days, and the shortest time was one day.

				<p>The rate of payment to sub-enumerators was 10s. per diem to those who acted on foot, and £1 to those who acted on horseback, finding their own horses ; and besides, each sub-enumerator was allowed half a day at the foot rate for making up his returns. The total amount paid was £11,631, or an average of £4 17s. 11d. to each sub-enumerator employed. The largest amount earned by any one persons was £20 5s., and the smallest was 10s.

				<p>Four of the sub-enumerators, viz., three in Brunswick and one in St. Kilda, were women. All the remainder were men. This being the first time female sub-enumerators had been employed in Victoria, it was deemed prudent to try the experiment only upon a small scale. As far as it went, however, it was successful, and no fault could be found with the way the work was done. It may be remarked that at the recent Census of England and Wales, also for the first time, a few female sub-enumerators were employed.
						<span class="annotation"> [Female sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">32.</h3>
				<p>Before the Census was taken, each enumerator was required to send in an estimate of the number of dwellings in his district, and this was some sort of guide as to the number of householders' and educational schedules required. These were forwarded to him with an addition of 10 per cent., or more in remote districts, to allow for contingencies. In most cases, however, requisitions were made for a further supply, and it was found necessary, as at every previous Census-taking, to cause a much larger number to be printed than was actually used. It will be readily understood that each sub-enumerator must be supplied with an extra number in case he might fall short owing to miscalculations as to his requirements on the part of the enumerator or some other cause ; then each enumerator must keep a supply in stock in case any sub-enumerator should fall short at the last moment notwithstanding this precaution, and a reserve must also be kept at the central office to supply any sudden demand. For these reasons, whilst the number of householders' and shipping schedules used numbered about 250,000, and the educational schedules used numbered a few thousand less, as many as 320,000 of either kind were received from the Government Printer, and nearly the whole of these were sent out to the enumerators. It will thus be seen that it was found necessary to print 28 per cent. more forms than the actual requirement, but this excess, large as it appears, was not so great as that at the Census of 1881, when the schedules printed exceeded by 43 per cent. the number which were used.

				<p>Some of the enumerators, after receiving their instructions, felt themselves unable to perform the duties of the office satisfactorily and resigned, and one enumerator who was found to be incompetent was removed. All who eventually acted were not equally efficient, but taken as a whole they were a superior class of men. Many changes took place in the ranks of the sub-enumerators, who were, also for the most part, above the average in point of intelligence and good conduct, but there were some exceptions, and a few instances occurred of their abandoning their work without giving notice to the enumerator, after they had commenced to deliver their schedules. As, however, the enumerators were on the alert, this was soon discovered, and fresh men were promptly appointed, so that the work of the Census did not suffer in consequence.

				<p>With the view of preparing the public mind for the approach of the Census, 15,000 printed notices of that event were issued under the signature of the Chief Secretary, and were posted by the police one week before the Census day at all police stations, railway stations, post-offices, and other prominent positions throughout the colony, and a copy of the same notice was thrice inserted in the<span class="emphasis">Government Gazette</span>and all newspapers. It was also translated into the Chinese language by Mr. C. P. Hodges, the well-known interpreter, and several thousand copies were posted in the Chinese quarters of the towns and gold-fields, a number being also distributed amongst the leading Chinese. Moreover, each sub-enumerator working amongst the Chinese carried a copy with him, in order to convince the people of that race that he had official warrant for asking the questions he did.
						<span class="annotation"> [Notices and advertisements of Census.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">37.</h3>
				<p>Following up the notice referred to, an advertisement was inserted in all the newspapers at short intervals extending over several weeks after the Census day, requesting that any cases of neglect on the part of sub-enumerators should be reported to the Government Statist, and at the same time reminding householders that communications addressed to that officer, either by post or wire, need not be prepaid. This elicited a number of complaints, which were at once referred to the enumerators for investigation. Many were found to be premature and others groundless. In some cases, however, it was ascertained that schedules had not been delivered, or had not been recovered ; and these omissions, which generally arose from some doubt as to the boundaries of sub-districts, were at once rectified. The advertisements were continued until no more replies were received, and as people generally appeared to take interest in the corrections of the Census, and evinced a desire to assist the department as much as possible in the matter of discovering omissions, it may be assumed with much confidence that, if any households were eventually overlooked, their number was so small as not to be worth mentioning.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">38.</h3>
				<p>A few instances occurred of persons escaping enumeration in consequence of their having changed their residences between the time of the schedules being deposited and the time they should have been collected ; and when this was proved to be the case a small allowance was made therefore, the numbers added being placed under the head of " Migratory Population." The whole amounted to only 1,209, viz.,

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">39.</h3>
				<p>The arrangements made for securing a speedy return of the principal results of the Census were similar to those which had been successfully adopted in 1881. Each sub-enumerator was instructed to make up and give in to his enumerator on the day following that on which he received the last of his returns, a statement of the number of persons in his sub-district, distinguishing Chinese and Aborigines, and the number of houses, whether inhabited, uninhabited, or in course of erection. From these statements the enumerator then made out a summary on a form supplied for that purpose, the total results relating to his district being shown on one line. Every exertion was used to get these summaries from the enumerators as speedily as possible, and when all were received, a table showing the unchecked totals of the population of each district, and of the colony as a whole, was at once prepared. This was furnished to the newspapers on the 4th May and was published on the following day. After the figures had been partially checked, ten tables were made out from the same summaries, giving copious details of the European, Chinese, and Aboriginal population in the counties, electoral provinces, electoral districts, and municipalities, as well as comparisons with former Censuses. These were sent to the Government Printer on the 19th May, and when printed were widely distributed. The tabulation of the Census returns, schedule by schedule, was at once commenced, and a series of tables embodying the finally corrected figures were published on the 8th October.

				<p>Fully twelve months before the period arrived for taking the Census, applications were received from persons desirous of being appointed to take part in its compilation, and a stream of such applications continued to flow in until some time after the enumeration had been made, the total number of applicants amounting to nearly 800. The right to make the selection from this army of candidates rested with the Public Service Board, but, in view of the difficulty it was supposed would be experienced in choosing the most suitable persons, the Government Statist was asked to submit the names of those he desired should be appointed. It was not until the lists had been carefully and anxiously scrutinized by that officer, and much outside pressure had been resisted, that the names were finally selected. As a result of the choice of his own subordinates being left to the Government Statist, the men appointed upon his recommendation were, upon the whole, of a superior class. There were a few exceptions, as there must always be whatever principle of selection is adopted, but the services of those officers who were found to be objectionable were not retained for a long period.

			<p>proceedings to the effect that the returns should be compiled as far as possible upon a uniform principle, and certain resolutions were agreed to for the purpose of insuring that this principle should be observed. The forms decided upon were mainly based upon those used in Victoria in connexion with the Census of 1881, almost the only exception being those relating to the Occupations of the People, in which considerable changes were made. These will be referred to later on, when the Census inquiry respecting occupations is being dealt with.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">43.</h3>
				<p>But whilst the form in which the results should appear was duly settled, the manner in which those results might be arrived at was left optional. It was generally understood, however, that in each of the colonies the card system of tabulation would be followed, which, although it had previously been used in this office for compiling returns of marriages and deaths, the criminal statistics, and the valuations of Friendly Societies, had never, it is believed, been used in any country as a means of compiling a Census until that practice was initiated by the present writer in connexion with the Census of 1881.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">44.</h3>
				<p>Before commencing the tabulation, a number was assigned to each Census district ; the schedules were then arranged in order, those relating to each place it was desired to distinguish being kept separate from the others by means of sheets of thick paper labeled with the Census district number, and with a second number, indicating the name of the county, electoral province, district, and division ; city, town, borough, or shire ; ward or riding ; township, village, or gold-working. When the arrangement of the schedules was completed, these were paged with a numbering machine, a number commencing afresh with No. 1 being assigned to each place, and then the first tabulation, " Inhabitants and Houses," was commenced. For this tabulation the information was extracted from the schedules upon sheets having columns ruled for the purpose, but all succeeding tabulations were effected by means of cards.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">45.</h3>
				<p>The ordinary cards used were of two colours, white and blue, one of the former being devoted to each male, and one of the latter to each female, of the population. There were, consequently, 598,414 white cards, and 541,991 blue cards, or 1,140,405 in all. The size of the cards was about 3 inches by 2¼ inches. Words and letters were printed upon them indicating as briefly as possible the places at which were to be entered the particulars returned on the Census schedule respecting the individual to whom the card referred, the schedule and the place to which it related being also indicated by numbers. In addition to these cards, green ones were also provided for the purpose of making duplicates of those on which information was entered which it was required to deal with specially. These comprised cards relating to French, Belgian, Italian, or Austro-Hungarian subjects, full particulars respecting whom—except names, which were withheld in view of the confidential character of the returns—had been promised to their respective Governments ; also those containing entries of native countries, or religious denominations, for which columns were not provided in the tabulation sheet ; of persons over 85 years of age ; of divorced persons ; of University graduates ; or of persons suffering from any illness or infirmity. The duplicate cards being all of one colour (green), a corner was cut off from those used for females, so that the sexes might be the more readily distinguished. The total number of duplicate cards used was about 30,000.

			<p>NOTE.—The abbreviations in the second line imply unmarried, married, widowed, and divorced ; the letters S and T at the end of the line " Religion" are to indicate whether the person was a Sunday School scholar or teacher ; the letters in the following line mean read and write, read only, and cannot read ; the letters M. and D. after " Occupation" are to show whether the person was a manufacturer or a dealer ; the letters in the last line but one indicate whether he was an employer of labour, on his own account without employing labour, a wage-earner, or was unemployed.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">47.</h3>
				<p>For the custody and arrangement of the cards boxes were provided, made of straw board, each box holding 500 cards. These boxes were all properly marked and labeled, and, when not in use, were placed in pigeon-holes and consigned to the charge of a trustworthy officer, so that any boxes wanted might be readily obtainable.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">48.</h3>
				<p>After the entries had been made upon the cards, and their correctness verified by examination, the next proceeding was to reduce the results to a tabular form. This was done by sorting the cards of each place into heaps, according to whatever head of inquiry it was desired to work out. Thus, in the case of the religions, say in Alberton Shire, County of Buln Buln, the cards of the members of the Church of England were sorted out, also those of the Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, Independents, Baptists, &amp;c. ; after which it was only necessary to count the cards in each heap, and to enter the numbers so obtained in the columns of specially-prepared tabulation sheets.<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>A reduced specimen of the sheet used for tabulating the birthplaces, religions, ages, education, and conjugal condition of males, also the occupations of the dependent or non-breadwinning classes, with pen and ink entries made in the columns, in order to show the state of the sheet when completed, is given on page 17. The sheet for females in no way differs from this except that the word "Females" is printed at the head instead of Males. A detailed account of the process of tabulation, by Mr. Joseph Hart, who was in immediate superintendence of the staff employed to compile the Census, is published immediately after this report.</p>
					</div>A precisely similar course was pursued in the case of the birthplaces, ages, education, and conjugal condition, also in the case of the occupations so far as certain leading lines were concerned. When the numbers had been entered upon the tabulation sheets, the totals were collected upon other sheets for the purpose of making summaries, after which the results were copied into the forms in which the tables were to appear when published.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">49.</h3>
				<p>The more detailed returns of occupations were, in the first instance, tabulated on sheets on which all known occupations had been printed, with columns placed

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_16"></div>
			<p>opposite to them for numbers, ages, &amp;c., figures indicating the order, sub-order, and line in which each occupation should be placed being also printed against it. The cards relating to the various occupations having been sorted and counted in the same way as has been explained in connexion with the other heads of inquiry, the numbers were entered in the proper columns. The sheets were then cut across between the lines, which had been left sufficiently wide apart for that purpose, and the slips so obtained—having the name of one occupation on each—were pasted on blank sheets of paper according to the order, sub-order, and line, after which the numbers were added, and the totals were carried into specially-ruled sheets prepared for the printer.<div class="footnote">* 
					<p>Reduced specimens of the slips referred to, after being arranged and added, are given at the back of the specimen tabulation sheet. See page 18.</p>
				</div></p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">50.</h3>
				<p>Before commencing any of the tabulations, the cards relating to the Chinese and Aborigines were placed apart, it having been agreed at the Census Conference that the returns of persons of these races—differing so much as they do from the remainder of the population in almost every respect—should be dealt with separately. All particulars relating to these peoples were, however, ascertained and tabulated in the same way as those relating to persons of European birth or origin.
						<span class="annotation"> [Tabulation of Chinese and Aborigines.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">51.</h3>
				<p>When the principal tables had been compiled, much still remained to be done. The green duplicate cards had to be dealt with for the purpose of making use of the information noted thereon. Special particulars were extracted respecting the Chinese and Aborigines ; inmates of hospitals, asylums, and gaols ; employers, employed, and unemployed, and a variety of other matters ; there were, moreover, numerous computations to be made showing averages, percentages, and comparisons with former Censuses of Victoria as well as with those of other countries. Upon the intelligent treatment of these and other minor matters much of the usefulness of a Census depends, and much valuable material would be lost were they not attended to. A Census being an expensive and infrequent operation, it is important that as much as possible should be made of the facts brought to light by its means, and that none should escape observation by reason of indolence on the part of the compiler or false economy on the part of the Government.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">52.</h3>
				<p>In tabulating the returns of a Census, much assistance may be derived from mechanical appliances. An exceedingly ingenious contrivance is used in the Census Office of the United States for performing all the operations connected with the tabulation by means of an " electrical tabulating machine" patented by Herman Hollerith, of Washington. The methods are stated to " consist essentially in first recording the data relating to each person by punching holes in sheets or strips of electrically non-conducting material (paper), and then counting or tallying these data, either separately or in combination, by means of mechanical counters operated by electro-magnets, the circuits through which are controlled by the perforated cards or strips." One of these machines was imported to Victoria by a Melbourne firm, and was carefully inspected by myself and other officers of this Department, the decision arrived at being that however suitable the system might be for dealing with a large population like that of the United States, it would be too costly, complicated, and cumbrous for use in connexion with so small a population as that of Victoria. It was felt, however, that much time would be saved if some contrivance could be devised for counting the cards more effectively and quickly than could be done by hand. To accomplish this, three machines based upon the principle of Waterlow's well-known

			<p>Railway ticket-counting machines were constructed by Messrs. Reid and Wheat, of Little Collins-street, Melbourne. These machines, though of considerable assistance, did not operate so smoothly as they would have done if all the cards had been of exactly the same size, which is necessary to insure their perfect working. Moreover, excellent numbering machines of colonial manufacture were used for paging the schedules, whilst Tate's Patent Arithmometer and Fuller's Spiral Slide Rule were found invaluable for making computations, the former proving much superior in point of durability to the French calculating machine (<span class="emphasis">L' Arithmometre</span>) made by Thomas, of Colmar, which was used at the Census of 1881, but which, in consequence of the softness of the metal used in its construction, was frequently out of order.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">53.</h3>
				<p>Whilst the tabulation was in progress, every care was taken to preserve the secrecy of the Census schedules in compliance with the Act, and strict injunctions were issued to the clerks in the Census Office not to reveal any portion of their contents, or even to make them a subject of conversation amongst themselves. Applications were several times made by the police and others to search the schedules for names, but these were invariably refused. To avoid a recurrence of such requests, as soon as the tabulation had been completed I applied to the Government for permission to destroy the documents, and this having been at once granted, the schedules were sent to a paper-mill and reduced to pulp in the presence of an officer who was instructed to keep the documents under observation until the process of destruction was complete.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">55.</h3>
				<p>According to the registrations, the excess of births over deaths between the Censuses of 1881 and 1891 was 161,699, viz., 73,406 of males and 88,293 of females. The colony not only retained a number equivalent to the whole of this natural increase, but gained in addition 116,360 persons, viz., 72,925 males and 43,435 females, by immigration. In the previous intercensal period, 1871 to 1881, the excess of registered births over registered deaths was, of males 66,923 and of females 78,980 ; but the colony lost by emigration a number of males equivalent to all those who arrived and 15,890 more, and a number of females equivalent to all who arrived except 805, so that, had there been no births, the net loss of population in those ten years would have been 15,085.</p>

				<p>Between the Censuses of 1881 and 1891 the excess of recorded arrivals by sea over recorded departures by sea was 183,347, viz., 126,817 of males, and 56,530 of females. If these numbers, and those just quoted showing the excess of births over deaths, had been correct, and the arrivals and departures overland had balanced each other, the Census would have shown a population of 1,207,392, viz., 652,306 males and 555,086 females, or 66,987, viz., 53,892 males and 13,095 females, more

			<p>than it actually did. The totals may to a certain extent have been affected by overland migration, of which no account is kept, but there is no doubt that the main disturbance has arisen from the circumstance that a large number of the departures by sea are unrecorded. The defective nature of the emigration returns being known, an allowance was made for it each quarter in the estimates of population published at those periods by the Government Statist, the whole allowance during the ten years 1881-91 being 52,131, viz., 41,333 males, and 10,798 females ; this reduction, however, turned out to be insufficient, as the estimate brought on to the Census day exceeded the population then enumerated by 14,856, viz., 12,559 males and 2,297 females. The following table shows the actual, apparent, and estimated population at the date of the Census of 1891, and the numbers by which the apparent and estimated exceeded the actual population :—</p>

				<p>During the period intervening between the last two Censuses, the recorded departures from the colony numbered 602, 189, viz., 411,792 males and 190,397 females. Adding the unrecorded departures as derived from the last column but one of the last table to these numbers, and calculating the proportion of such departures to the whole, it is found that nearly 10 per cent. of those who left the colony in the ten years ended with the Census day 1891, viz., 11½ per cent. of the males, and 6[formula]per cent. of the females, passed out by sea or over the borders without their departure being officially recognized. In the ten years 1871-81 these proportions were as follow :—Both sexes 17 per cent. ; males, 19 per cent.; females 11 per cent.

				<span class="annotation"> [(1) Since the Census was taken, the Government Statistician of New South Wales has amended his totals of immigration and emigration for the intercensal period 1881-91, thereby causing the difference between the apparent and enumerated population 1891 to appear less than that shown by the figures in this line, which are based upon the returns which had been published from year to year up to the time the Census of 1891 was taken.] </span>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">60.</h3>
				<p>According to the figures, much the largest deficiency occurred in New South Wales, but only as regards the males. This is probably due to a large number having crossed the border to Queensland, where the deficiency of males as compared with that of females is less than in the other colonies. The small surplus of males in Western Australia is, perhaps, to be accounted for by men having come over the frontier of that colony from the Northern Territory of South Australia in numbers sufficiently great to more than counteract the loss sustained by unrecorded emigration by sea.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">61.</h3>
				<p>It will be observed that the deficiency of males is more than three times that of females. This is probably accounted for by the circumstance that when taking a sea voyage the passages of the latter are more frequently taken beforehand than those of the former ; it being an ascertained fact that the unrecorded persons are, for the most part, those who fail to take this precaution.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">62.</h3>
				<p>In the insular colonies of Australasia the Census returns indicate a loss by unrecorded emigration similar to that occurring in the continental colonies. Thus the population enumerated at the Census of 1891 was less than the apparent population by 10,338, viz., 6,967 males and 3,371 females, in Tasmania ; and by 15,265, viz., 10,918 males and 4,347 females, in New Zealand.

				<p>The Census of 1891 showed Victoria to be still the most populous colony in the Australasian group. The male population of New South Wales exceeded that of Victoria, but the effect of this upon the numbers of the total population was neutralized by the large excess of females in this colony. The official estimates published prior to the Census indicated that New South Wales had a larger population than Victoria, but the simultaneous enumeration of the two colonies has shown the reverse to be the case, the total excess in favour of Victoria being 8,171, viz., 22,319 females, less 14,148 males.</p>

				<p>Chinese first began to arrive in Victoria in 1853 ; and at the Census of 1854, 2,000 were enumerated. In 1855 an Act was passed limiting the number of Chinese males a ship might bring to Victoria to one to every 10 tons, and making it compulsory that the sum of £10 should be paid in respect to each of such immigrants. But, notwithstanding the stringent provisions of this statute, which, however, were largely evaded by Chinese being landed in the adjacent colonies and coming overland to Victoria, the Chinese had in 1857, when the next Census was taken, increased to 25,424 ; and at the end of 1859 it was estimated that they numbered no less than 42,000. Soon after this an exodus of Chinese took place, chiefly to New South Wales, it being estimated that, besides those who departed by sea, as many as 11,000 went over the frontier to work at the Lambing Flat diggings in that colony. In consequence of this the Census of 1861 showed the number of Chinese remaining in Victoria to be only 24,732, or 692 less than in 1857. In 1865 the Act which imposed restrictions on Chinese immigration was repealed ; but, notwithstanding this, the number of Chinese in the colony had decreased by the time the Census of 1871 was taken to 17,935, or by 6,797 as compared with 1861 ; which number at the Census of 1881 had been still further reduced to 12,128, or by 5,807 more. Since that Census two Acts imposing restrictions on Chinese immigration have been passed, the first being The<span class="emphasis">Chinese Act</span>1881, 45 Vic., No. 723 (1st April, 1882), which limited the number of Chinese immigrants a ship might bring to Victoria to one to every 100 tons, and imposed on each of such immigrants a tax of £10, to be paid before the left the vessel. These provisions were repealed by<span class="emphasis">The Chinese Immigration Restriction</span>

The Victorian Act abolished the poll tax, but provided that no vessel should enter any port in this colony having on board more than one Chinese to every 500 tons of her burden, and that in the event of any vessel bringing more than this proportion, her owner, master, or charterer would be liable to a penalty of £500 for every one by which it should be exceeded ; also that any Chinese who should enter Victoria by land should obtain a permit in writing from an officer duly appointed to grant it, and failing to do so should be liable to a penalty ranging from £5 to £20, and, in addition to or substitution for such penalty, to be deported to the colony whence he came ; this provision, however, to remain in abeyance until put in operation by the Governor in Council, which has not yet been done.

				<p>At the first colonization of the district now called Victoria, the Aborigines were officially estimated to number about 5,000 ; but according to other, and apparently more reliable, estimates they numbered at that time not less than 15,000. At the Census of 1891, only 565 Aborigines, viz., 325 males and 240 females were enumerated. It is tolerably certain, however, that there are more in the colony than are shown by the figures. In consequence of the nomadic habits of this people, some may have been missed by the sub-enumerators ; and it is, moreover, possible that the latter sometimes failed to comply with the instruction to note the fact of the person being an Aboriginal by marking the letter " A" after the birthplace entry on the Census schedule, and in consequence it might possibly not be recognized that he was one. The Central Board for the Protection of the Aborigines state that they have information of the existence of 731 Aborigines in the colony.

				<p>In most, if not all the Australasian Colonies, the enumeration of the Aborigines was incomplete. It has been already stated that, in Victoria, whilst only 565 (including half-castes) were enumerated, 731 are believed to be in existence. In Queensland no attempt was made to enumerate or estimate the number of Aborigines, therefore the number returned in 1881, which is believed very much to understate the truth, has been repeated. In South Australia, the Aborigines were not regularly enumerated, the figures given being derived from estimates made by the Census collectors. In Western Australia only civilized Aborigines were enumerated. In the numbers given for that colony, 575, viz., 293 males and 282 females, are half-castes. In Tasmania there are no longer any Aborigines of unmixed race, the last male having died in 1869, and the last female in 1876. There are, however, a few half-castes. With the Maoris of New Zealand, 40 Morioris, viz., 26 males and 14 females, are included. These are the last surviving Aboriginal inhabitants of the Chatham Islands, which is a group lying about 360 miles to the east of New Zealand, in latitude 43° 50′ S., longitude 177° E., and is a dependency of that colony.</p>

				<p>Victoria is divided into (1) thirty-seven counties ; (2) sixty urban municipalities, viz., eleven cities, nine towns, and forty boroughs, and one hundred and thirty-seven country municipalities or shires ; (3) fourteen electoral provinces returning members to the Upper House ; (4) eighty-four electoral districts returning members to the Lower House. These divisions do not fit in with each other, the boundaries crossing in many directions ; the population of each of the different divisions, and of their respective subdivisions, however, have been ascertained from the Census returns, and the numbers are given in the tables which have been laid before Parliament.

				<p>The county with the largest population is Bourke, in which the metropolis is situated. The persons returned therein numbered 517,009, or nearly half (five-elevenths) of the population of the colony. The next most populous county is Grant (69,599), in which Geelong and the greater part of Ballarat East are situated ; then Talbot (59,088), containing Castlemaine, Chewton, Daylesford, Maryborough, and Creswick ; Bendigo (52,756), containing Bendigo City and Eaglehawk ; and Grenville (41,975), containing Ballarat and a small portion of Ballarat East. The counties having the smallest populations are Weeah with only 14, and Millewa with only 172 inhabitants. Both are situated in the mallee portion of the Wimmera district, at the extreme north-west of the colony. Next to these are Croajingolong, Wonnangatta, and Tambo, in Gippsland, with 1,779, 2,068, and 2,262 inhabitants ; then Follett, abutting on the frontier of South Australia, at the south-western part of Victoria, with 2,749 inhabitants.

				<p>Of the urban municipalities, Melbourne is the most populous, with 73,361 inhabitants. The only towns found to contain more than half that number were South Melbourne with 41,724, Prahran with 39,703, and Richmond with 38,797 inhabitants. These are suburbs of Melbourne, as also are Collingwood with 35,070, Fitzroy with 32,453, Brunswick with 21,961, North Melbourne with 20,997, St. Kilda with 19,838, Hawthorn with 19,585, Footscray with 19,149, Williamstown with 15,960, Essendon with 14,411, Port Melbourne, with 13,067, Flemington and Kensington with 9,958, Brighton with 9,858 inhabitants, and several less populous towns. Of the extra-metropolitan towns, the most populous are Bendigo with 26,774, Ballarat with 24,257, Ballarat East with 16,592, Geelong with 11,666, Warrnambool with 6,582, Geelong West with 5,779, Stawell with 5,183, Maryborough with 4,994, and Castlemaine with 4,770 inhabitants.</p>

				<p>The populations of the towns just mentioned are those included within their municipal limits, but instances occur of several municipalities lying close to one another, and virtually forming parts of one town, in which case it is customary when naming the population of the principal town of the group, to give that of the whole. Thus Melbourne with its immediate suburbs (Greater Melbourne) contains 9 cities, 6 towns, 4 boroughs, 5 complete shires, and 12 parts of shires, the whole extending in all directions for a distance of ten miles from the Melbourne Post-office.

				<p>Besides the existing urban municipalities, there are 16 towns which were at one time boroughs, but have since ceased to have an independent municipal existence, and have become embodied in shires. Some of these still maintain considerable populations, whilst in others—generally in consequence of the exhaustion of goldfields to which they originally owed their existence—the population has dwindled to a mere fraction of what it was formerly. The names of these towns, and their Census populations, are as follow :—Kyneton, 3,371 ; Beechworth, 2,528 ; Walhalla, 1,771 ; Maldon, 1,692 ; South Barwon (including Belmont), 1,589 ; Chiltern, 1,351 ; Kilmore, 1,122 ; Woodend, 1,021 ; Avoca, 787 ; Gisborne, 413 ; Taradale, 322 ; Moonambel, 309 ; Steiglitz, 265 ; Guildford, 236 ; Jamieson, 223 ; Graytown, 104. The total is 17,104, which, added to the population of present cities, towns, and boroughs (620,240), gives a total of 637,344 for the urban population of Victoria.

				<p>Omitting Queensland, in which no estimate was made of the number of Aborigines in 1891, the returns, as compared with those of 1881, show larger numbers for all the colonies except Victoria and New Zealand ; but this does not arise from the Aborigines having increased numerically during the intercensal period, but merely from the fact of the enumeration of the Aborigines having been more complete in 1891 than on the previous occasion. In 1881 only the civilized Aborigines were enumerated in New South Wales and South Australia, whereas in 1891 an attempt was made to ascertain their total numbers. In Western Australia no other than the civilized Aborigines were returned at either period, but the returns show a larger number by nearly 4,000 living in civilization at the latter period than at the former. In Tasmania it is probable that as many Aborigines (all half-castes) existed in 1881 as in 1891, but</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_42"></div>

				<p>In all countries, although a few more boys are born than girls, fewer of the former than the latter survive the period of infancy, the result being that in early life the proportions of the sexes are about equal. Amongst adults, however, in consequence of the expectation of life being less in males than in females the numbers of the latter would always exceed those of the former did no disturbance arise from immigration or emigration. In most old countries this natural preponderance of females is added to by the tendency of men to emigrate being greater than that of women, also by the numbers who go abroad as soldiers and sailors ; but in most new countries the preponderance of females gives place to one of males, through there being an excess of male over female immigrants, whilst there is but little emigration, and, as a rule, but few sailors and no soldiers are absent from the country.

Up to 1881 the returns of each succeeding Census showed that the sexes were approaching more closely towards uniformity, the proportion to 100 males being 82 females in 1871, 64 females in 1861, 55 females in 1857, and 52 females in 1854.</p>

The closest approach to equality was in Grenville, in which Ballarat City and Sebastopol are situated, with 99 females to 100 males, the next closest being in Bourke, in which, as already stated, the proportion is 98. After these two, the counties in which the sexes were found to be most nearly equal in numbers were Grant, in which Geelong and Ballarat East are situated, with nearly 98 females to 100 males ; Bendigo, in which Bendigo City and Eaglehawk are situated, and Normanby, in which Portland is situated, with 94 ; Dundas, in which Hamilton is situated, with 90 ; and Tanjil, in which Sale and Bairnsdale are situated, also with 90. The counties in which the inequality of the sexes was most marked were Weeah, Karkarooc, Millewa, and Tatchera, situated in the Mallee district, with respectively 17, 50, 62, and 66 females to 100 males ; and Croajingolong, Dargo, and Tambo, situated in the eastern part of Gippsland, with respectively 58, 62, and 66 females to 100 males.

				<p>From the figures in the total line of the last two columns, it appears that if the colony were to be mapped out in allotments (necessarily of hexagonal form), each allotment containing 49[FORMULA] acres, there would be one such allotment for each man, woman, and child in Victoria ; and should each person stand in the centre of his allotment, he would be 526 yards, or nearly a third of a mile from his nearest neighbour.

In the other counties the population is much less dense. In Grant there are nearly 38 persons to the square mile, 17 acres to each person, and the inhabitants are, on the average, something less than 14 chains, or about 307 yards apart ; in Talbot there are 36½ persons to the square mile, nearly 17[FORMULA] acres to each persons, and the inhabitants are, on the average, 14¼ chains, or about 313 yards apart ; and in Bendigo there are 27 persons to the square mile, something less than 23[FORMULA]; acres to each person, and the inhabitants are, on the average, about 16½ chains, or nearly 364 yards apart. These are the counties in which the population is densest ; those in which it is least dense are Weeah, in which there is only one person to every 286 square miles ; Millewa, in which there is one to every 20 square miles ; Croajingolong, in which there is one to 2 square miles ; Karkarooc, in which there is one to about 1¾ square miles ; Wonnangatta, in which there is something under one to a mile, &amp;c.

				<p>By the figures it would appear that the inhabitants of Sydney dwell in closer contiguity than those of any of the other capital cities of Australasia. In the district subject to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, however—which is smaller than Greater Melbourne, and slightly smaller than Greater Sydney—the inhabitants are nearer together than they are in Sydney, the population being 476,849, spread over an area of 83,860 acres, or as many as 5.69 persons to the acre.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">176.</h3>
				<p>The number of habitations of all descriptions returned in 1891 was 241,560. Of these, 235,434 were dwelling-houses properly so called ; 264 were stores, offices, or public buildings in which some one abode on the Census night, and 5,862 were huts or tents. In accordance with the practice observed on previous occasions, no account was taken of unoccupied huts or tents, or of stores, offices, or public buildings in which there were no resident caretakers.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">177.</h3>
				<p>Between the Censuses of 1881 and 1891, the habitations of all kinds increased by 61,744, or 34 per cent. ; this proportion is rather larger than that indicating the increase of population during the same interval, which was 32 per cent.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">178.</h3>
				<p>Of the total number of habitations, 224,021, or nearly 93 per cent., were in occupation ; 15,846, or rather over 6 per cent., were vacant ; and 1,693, or not quite 1 per cent., were being built.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">179.</h3>
				<p>Of the occupied habitations, 120,841 were in cities, towns, and boroughs, 103,154 in shires, and 26 in places outside local jurisdiction. Since 1881 the total number increased by 53,935 ; the increase in cities, towns, and boroughs being 36,887, and that in shires, 18,075, whilst, in consequence of the extension of municipal government, the number outside local jurisdiction decreased by 1,027. It will be noticed that the increase of town dwellings was twice as great as that of dwellings situated in country districts.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">180.</h3>
				<p>Occupied dwellings increased in most of the counties during the intercensal period, the exceptions being Bendigo, Bogong, Gladstone, Grenville, Kara Kara, Millewa, Ripon, Talbot, and Wonnangatta. In all of these, except Bogong and Millewa, the population also declined ; but in Normanby, whilst the population decreased by 6, there was an increase of 70 in the number of inhabited dwellings.

				<p>In Greater Melbourne, the number of inhabited dwellings rose from 52,131 in 1881 to 93,617 in 1891, the increase being 41,486, or nearly 80 per cent. The whole increase of such dwellings in the colony was 53,935, more than three-fourths of which increase was in Greater Melbourne.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">182.</h3>
				<p>The unoccupied habitations in 1891 were more numerous by 6,797 than in 1881, and bore a proportion to the whole number of dwellings of 6½ per cent. as against 5 per cent. In 1891, 8,564 of the vacant dwellings were in cities, towns, and boroughs, and 7,282 were in shires ; about half, viz., 8,043 were in Greater Melbourne, the largest numbers being in Richmond 811, Melbourne City 795, Brunswick 657, Prahran 647, South Melbourne 603, Collingwood 488, Hawthorn 397, Fitzroy 393, St. Kilda 389, Caulfield 362, Essendon 297, Coburg 249, Brighton 221, and Northcote 217. It is unlikely that there were as many vacant dwellings in Melbourne City as stated, the probability being that the sub-enumerators, in some instances, set down stores or suites of offices which were untenanted or used only during the day as unoccupied dwellings, although they were distinctly told to make no return of such edifices.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">183.</h3>
				<p>Of the houses in course of erection, 1,038 out of 1,693 were in Greater Melbourne, the largest numbers being in Essendon 92, Prahran 70, Hawthorn and Brunswick each 69, South Melbourne 65, Northcote 62, Melbourne City 60, and Malvern 57. In 1881, the whole number of unfinished houses in the colony was 681, or 1,012 less than in 1891.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">186.</h3>
				<p>As time advances and families become larger, the houses are built to contain increased accommodation. This is demonstrated by the fact that, whilst the average number of rooms to a dwelling was only 2.66 in 1857, it was, 2.96 in 1861, 3.89 in 1871, 4.44 in 1881, and over 5 (5.15) in 1891.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">187.</h3>
				<p>In 1891 by far the largest number of houses, amounting to more than two thirds of the whole, contained from 3 to 6 rooms. About an eighth had less than 3 rooms, and about a fifth had over 6 rooms ; 2,899 had more than 15 rooms, and of these 1,226 had at least 20 rooms.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">188.</h3>
				<p>In town districts the houses possessed, on the average, more accommodation than those in country districts, as is evidenced by the fact that in cities, towns, and boroughs there were 677,891 rooms in 125,183 houses, or 5.42 rooms to a house ; whilst in shires there were 517,823 rooms in 107,173 houses, or only 4.83 rooms to a house.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">189.</h3>
				<p>The houses, on the average, were more commodious in 1891 than in 1881, for, where as the proportion of 1 and 2 roomed houses to the whole number of houses was as high as 22.30 per cent. in 1881, it was only 12.26 per cent. in 1891. On the other hand, whilst the proportion of houses containing from 3 to 6 rooms to the whole number was only 63.48 per cent. in 1881, it was as high as 67.55 per cent. in 1891 ; and whilst the proportion of houses containing more than 6 rooms to the whole number was as low as 14.22 per cent. in 1881, it was as high as 20.19 per cent. in 1891.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">190.</h3>
				<p>The number of rooms in 1891 exceeded that in 1881 by 430,453. It is customary for professional valuers to roughly estimate the worth of house property at so much per room, the lowest valuation in the case of wooden houses being £50 for each apartment. Brick and stone houses, however, increased between the Censuses by 23,930, and in the case of these the average value per room would probably not be less than £100. Taking a mean of £70 as certainly not too high a valuation for the whole, it would follow that over 30 millions sterling (£30,131,700) had been expended during the ten years, 1881-91, on the erection of dwelling-houses, this being exclusive of the large amounts spent in erecting churches, public buildings, stores, suites of offices, &amp;c.

				<p>The total number of rooms in all the dwelling-houses respecting which the information was given was 1,195,792. Estimating the 9,183 houses respecting which the number of rooms was not returned to have contained 36,732 rooms, or an average of 4 rooms to each, the total number of rooms would be 1,232,524, which, at £70 per room, would show the total value of dwelling-houses—irrespective of the land they stand on—to be 86¼ millions sterling (£86,276,680).
						<span class="annotation"> [Total value of dwelling-houses.] </span>

				<p>According to the municipal valuations for 1891, the total value of rateable property in the colony was 203[FORMULA] millions sterling (£203,351,360). This includes both land and houses ; if the true value is represented, and the foregoing estimate for the value of dwelling-houses is also correct, the value of lands and estates, irrespective of the edifices erected thereon, must amount to 117 millions sterling.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">194.</h3>
				<p>Roughly speaking, each inhabited house represents a family, which being the case, an equal division of the area of the colony would result in each family having an allotment of 251 acres and 16 perches. Supposing the families to live in houses built in the centre of their allotments, any individual wishing to visit the dwelling of one of his nearest neighbours would have to travel 1,184 yards, or about two-thirds of a mile.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">195.</h3>
				<p>In Victoria as a whole, there were, according to the table, over 2½ (2.55) inhabited houses to the square mile. In 1881 there were not quite 2 (1.93) such houses, and in 1871 not quite 1¾ (1.71) such houses to the square mile.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">196.</h3>
				<p>In 1891 inhabited houses in the county of Bourke were in the proportion of 57½ to the square mile, and were very much closer together than in any other county ; but the large majority of these houses were in Greater Melbourne (about 254 square miles) in which inhabited houses averaged 366 to the square mile. If the area and population of Greater Melbourne be excluded, there were, in the remainder of Bourke, 1,465 square miles and no more than 5,327 inhabited dwellings, which numbers furnish an average of only 3.6 dwellings to the square mile, that being not half as much again as the mean density of houses in the colony as a whole.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">197.</h3>
				<p>It may be readily found from the figures in the last column that if a sub-enumerator had to leave schedules at, or a rate collector had to visit, 100 houses of average proximity equal to that of the colony as a whole, and he could go in a direct line from house to house, it would be necessary for him to travel 67 miles and 528 yards, but if equal to the average of Bourke only 14 miles and 308 yards, whilst if the houses were as far apart as the average of Weeah he would have to travel no less than 3,400 miles, or if equal to the average of Croajingolong as much as 305 miles and 100 yards, &amp;c.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">198.</h3>
				<p>At the period of the Census 1,113,405 persons, or nearly 98 per cent. of the population, were living in houses properly so called ; 12,537, or about 1 per cent., were living in slab, bark, or mud huts ; 11,119, or rather less than 1 per cent., were living in tents or dwellings with canvas roofs ; 2,439, or 1 in 468, were living in ships ; and 905, or 1 in 1,260, were camping out.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">199.</h3>
				<p>At no previous Census, since the discovery of gold, were the inhabitants of the colony found to be so well housed as at that under review, for whereas nearly 98 per cent. of the population were living in houses properly so called (i.e., exclusive of huts and tents) in 1891, only 95 per cent. were so living in 1881, less than 93 per cent. in 1871, only 69 per cent. in 1861, and only 63 per cent. in 1857.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">200.</h3>
				<p>Since the mining population do not, as a rule, now live in tents, the tent dwellers in 1891 were mainly those engaged in the construction of railways or other public works, whose practice it is, at or near the scene of their labours, to form encampments, which are moved from time to time as the work progresses ; some of the tent dwellers, moreover, were land selectors occupying tents pending the erection of their more permanent habitations. In the early days of the gold discoveries the diggers, who then formed a considerable proportion of the inhabitants of the colony, almost invariably lived in tents, as many as 136,000 persons out of a total population of 411,000 being found to be so sheltered in 1857. This number had fallen to 123,000 out of a population of 540,000 in 1861, but the greatest fall took place between 1861 and 1871 ; at the latter date only 8,660 persons out of a population of 732,000 being

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_59"></div>
			<p>found to be living in tents. In 1881 this number had become further reduced to 4,661 out of a population of 862,000, but in 1891 the number had again risen to 11,119 out of a population of 1,140,000, the proportion being nearly twice as high as in 1881, although lower than at any previous Census period.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">201.</h3>
				<p>Taking into account all the houses in the colony, whether tenanted or not, the number of persons to a house was 4.71 in 1891, but if only the occupied houses be considered, the number to each was about 5 (5.08). This average differed from that in 1881 by a small fraction only, the proportion then being 5.06. In 1871 the average number of persons to an occupied dwelling was 4.84 ; in 1861 it was 4.16 ; and in 1857 it was 4.21.

				<p>The number of persons to an occupied dwelling varies in different counties. In Millewa there were between 6 and 7 to each, the total population of that county, however, being only 172, and the number of occupied habitations only 25. In Anglesey, Benambra, Bogong, Borung, Bourke, Dundas, Follett, Grant, Gunbower, Hampden, Heytesbury, Lowan, Moira, Normanby, Polwarth, Ripon, Rodney, Tambo, Tanjil, and Villiers there were between 5 and 6 persons to each occupied dwelling ; in Bendigo, Buln Buln, Croajingolong, Dalhousie, Dargo, Delatite, Evelyn, Gladstone, Grenville, Kara Kara, Mornington, Talbot, and Tatchera there were between 4 and 5 to each ; and in Karkarooc, Weeah, and Wonnangatta there were between 3 and 4 to each.

				<p>Prior to the discovery of gold nearly the whole population was of British allegiance. Soon after that event, however, many foreigners having been attracted to Victoria by the fame of the gold-fields, over 5 per cent. of the population in 1854, and nearly 11 per cent. in 1857, were found to be of foreign nationality. The latter was the highest point reached, each Census since that period having shown a lower proportion of foreign and, as a natural consequence, a higher one of British subjects.

				<p>The Census of 1881 was the first at which more than half the population of Victoria consisted of natives of the colony ; the proportion was then 58 per cent., whilst according to the returns of the Census under notice it now approaches to two-thirds of the whole, viz., 63 per cent. In 1871 the proportion of Victorian natives in the population was 45 per cent. ; in 1861, 26 per cent. ; in 1857, 17 per cent. ; and in 1854, 13 per cent.</p>

				<p>Between the Censuses of 1881 and 1891, male Victorian natives resident in the colony of their birth increased by 107,198, and female Victorian natives there resident increased by 107,188. During the same interval 161,128 male infants and 153,407 female infants were born in Victoria, and there were doubtless some Victorian natives absent from the colony in 1881, but who returned afterwards. From these circumstances it follows that more than 53,930 males and more than 46,219 females of Victorian birth must either have died or left the colony during the intercensal period.</p>

			<p>to the numbers in 1891 the order would have been the same, except that Tasmania would have changed places with, and stood above, New Zealand. It will further be noticed that the number of Tasmanians in Victoria in 1881 was larger than that of natives of any of the other colonies of the group, but in 1891 natives of South Australia and New South Wales resident in Victoria were both more numerous than those of Tasmania.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">226.</h3>
				<p>Amongst Victorian natives the females exceeded the males by 4,133. Amongst natives of four of the other Australasian Colonies living in Victoria females were also the more numerous, viz., those of New South Wales by 318, of Queensland by 197, of Western Australia by 52, and of Tasmania by 1,064. On the other hand, in the case of natives of South Australia and New Zealand, the males outnumbered the females, in the former by 828 and in the latter by 624. This would appear to indicate that the men came to Victoria from those two colonies in order to obtain work, but, not intending to make it their home, in many instances did not bring their families with them.</p>

				<p>After natives of the Australasian Colonies, persons born in the United Kingdom formed the most numerous section of the population. These numbered close upon 300,000 (298,881), and amounted to rather more than a fourth of the population. Upwards of half (53 per cent.) were natives of England ; over a fourth (28 per cent.) were natives of Ireland ; about a sixth (17 per cent.) were natives of Scotland, and 2 per cent. were natives of Wales.

In the case of those born in Europe there was a falling-off of 5 as compared with 1881, which reduction would not have occurred if Heligoland had not been ceded to a foreign country, which resulted in 8 natives of that island returned in 1891 being necessarily classed as foreigners.

				<p>It will be observed that Victoria sends more of her natives to New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia than she receives of their natives, but the reverse is the case as regards South Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. The natives received from the last three over and above those parted with to the first three colonies is in favour of Victoria to the extent of 8,027 persons, as shown in the table.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">247.</h3>
				<p>No resident of Victoria can persist in refusing to supply an answer to any of the inquiries embodied in the Census Schedule without rendering himself liable to a penalty except in the case of the inquiry as to religion, in respect to which any one not wishing to give the information is at liberty to cause the word " object " to be entered in its stead.
						<span class="annotation"> [Religions of the people, Table XXVI. et seq.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">248.</h3>
				<p>That the question should even be asked is considered undesirable by some persons. In England, Scotland, and Wales the opposition to it has been so strong that the Government have never succeeded in getting legal authority to its being put. In Ireland, however, the inquiry is always made when a Census is taken, and is responded to without demur.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">249.</h3>
				<p>It is stated that in Great Britain the opposition to a Census of religions comes mainly from the dissenting bodies, whose adherents fear that a large number of those persons who are indifferent to all religions and never enter a church of chapel would, if such an inquiry were sanctioned, set themselves down as members of that denomination which is held to be the most aristocratic and fashionable, and the apparent strength of the Church of England would be unjustly and improperly added</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_71"></div>
			<p>to thereby. It is maintained, moreover, by some that a man's religious belief, being a matter between himself and a Higher Power, is a secret of the heart which no Government has any right to pry into.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">250.</h3>
				<p>There being no established church in Victoria, no one denomination possesses any legal or recognised superiority over another. Still, there is no doubt that, from the fact of its being considered respectable to have a religion of some kind, many who pay no heed to, and perhaps place no credence in, the dogmas taught by any religious body cause themselves to be entered at the Census as members of one or other of the denominations, and, for this reason, the return is to a certain extent misleading. No determined opposition, however, has ever been made in Victoria to the embodiment of the inquiry in the Census Schedule, subject to the option of refusing to respond to it if desired. This permission has been given at the last four Censuses, but on each of those occasions comparatively few persons availed themselves of the privilege.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">251.</h3>
				<p>The number of those who signified their objection to state their religion in 1891 was 13,608 out of a total population of 1,140,405, or 1 in 84. The proportion of such persons in 1881 was 1 in 100, in 1871 it was 1 in 73, and in 1861 it was 1 in 47.
						<span class="annotation"> [Objecting to state religion.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">252.</h3>
				<p>In classifying the religions, the exact entry made in the Census Schedule was copied upon the cards and afterwards placed under the proper head, and in the event of there being no entry of religion in the schedule, the person, if an adult, was set down as unspecified. In regard to children respecting whom no return of religion was made, the recommendation adopted by the Census Conference already alluded to, was followed ; this was to the effect that such children should be tabulated as of the religion of their parents if the father and mother were stated to be of the same religion, or of the religion of one parent if specified ; but that if the parents were of different religions, no assumption should be made as to the religion it was intended to bring the children up to, who should be classed as unspecified. Should, however, a woman of European birth or extraction be married to a Chinaman, the children, if unspecified, should be entered as of the religion of the mother.

				<p>According to the figures, the proportion to the population of members of the Church of England was higher in 1891 than either in 1881 or 1871, but not so high as in 1861 ; the proportion of Presbyterians was lower and that of Baptists was higher at each period named than it was at the preceding one ; the proportion of Independents was highest in 1871, and lowest in 1891.</p>

				<p>Between 1881 and 1891, members of the Church of England, with whom are combined Protestants, so returned, and a few persons set down as of the Free Church of England, increased by 105,891, or 34 per cent. This growth is rather greater than that of the whole population during the same period, which was only at the rate of 32 per cent.

				<p>In virtue of an agreement entered into between the heads of the two principal branches of the Presbyterian Church, which was communicated to the Census Office before the Census was taken, all persons who were set down as Presbyterians without qualification or as of the Church of Scotland were tabulated as of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, and all set down as Free Presbyterians or as of the Free Church of Scotland were tabulated as of the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria. Adopting the same arrangement for 1881—which was not agreed to at that time—adherents of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria are found to have increased by 38,522, whilst those of the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria diminished by 1,899. Combining these with members of other Presbyterian bodies, which were also fewer in 1891 than in 1881, the net increase of the denomination during the intercensal period was 34,436, or at the rate of 26 per cent.

				<p>Of the various Methodist bodies the principal are the Wesleyans, who increased by 37,726 between the Censuses. In the same interval the Primitive Methodists increased by 2,644, the Bible Christians by 2,919, and the United Methodists by 644. Besides these a few adherents of minor Methodist bodies were returned in 1881 but not in 1891. The denomination, as a whole, increased in the decade by 42,987, or at the rate of 37 per cent. This was a higher rate of increase than that of either the Church of England or the Presbyterian Church.

				<p>Jews, who numbered 4,330 in 1881, increased to 6,459 in 1891, or by about 50 per cent. This large increase, taken in connexion with the fact that Russians in Victoria were more than three times as numerous in 1891 as in 1881, points to the probability of this large addition to the Jewish portion of the community being to a great extent made up of refugees from Russia.

				<p>Besides the Jews and the non-Christian Chinese sects, 25 other sects or denominations having no connexion with either Protestant or Catholic bodies found place in the Census returns. The most important of these, numerically, are the Spiritists, who declined from 853 in 1881 to 790 ; the Catholic Apostolic Church, votaries of which increased from 383 to 407 ; the New or Swedenborgian Church, members of which increased from 292 to 305 ; Israelites, who rose from 238 to 293 ; Mohammedans, who rose from 111 to 241 ; and Mormons, who rose from 15 to 48.

Amongst the following also males were the more numerous, the proportion of females to every 100 of the other sex being—amongst Independents 98, Presbyterians 93, members of the Church of England 90, Jews 83, Lutherans 57, and Buddhists, Confucians, &amp;c., less than 2. Amongst the following, females were more numerous than males, their proportions per 100 of the latter being—amongst Baptists 107, Disciples of Christ 106, and Methodists 102. In the Salvation Army the sexes were about equal, the males and females numbering respectively 6,753 and 6,768. Amongst persons returned as of No Denomination of the proportion of females per 100 males was 40, amongst those returned as of No Religion it was 26, and amongst those who objected to state their religion it was 46.

					<p>On this subject the late Mr. E. M. Curr, in his work " The Australian Race." has remarked as follows, volume I., page 44 :— " Whether the blacks have any knowledge of a God is doubtful. That nothing of the nature of worship, prayer, or sacrifice has been observed is certain. As far as is known, all tribes believe in the existence of beings which partake of the nature of both spirits and bodies ; they fear them, and attribute to them some of the powers which Christians refer to God. That the blacks commonly believe that man has a spiritual part I have no doubt. " Mr. A. A. C. Le Souef, in an Appendix to the late Mr. Brough Smyth's work on the Aborigines, volume II., page 295, says—"I never could discover anything among them approaching to religion ; they certainly have a vague idea that when they die they will, as they express it, " jump up whitefellow,' but the superstition must, of course, be of recent origin. They also believe in evil spirits which roam about at night ; and in others which cause sickness, and which the doctors of the tribe try to exercise by placing their mouths on the part affected, and speaking or chanting in a singular and rapid manner. But all superstitions bearing on this subject are so utterly vague—they being unable to explain anything themselves—that it is impossible to make head or tail of it. My opinion is that they have no religious notions whatever. " Mr. James Dawson, in his work, " The Australian Aborigines," page 49, says—"They believe in supernatural beings, good and bad. The good spirit is a gigantic man, living among the clouds ; and, as he is of a kindly disposition and harms no one, he is seldom mentioned, but always with respect. The bad spirit is always spoken of with fear and bated breath as the author of every misfortune. He visits the earth in the form of lightning, knocking trees to pieces and killing people. At times he assumes the form of a large ugly man, frequenting scrubs and thickets ; and, although not provided with wings, like the whiteman's devil, he flits and darts from place to place with the rapidity of lighting, is very mischievous, and hungers for the flesh of children."</p>

			<h1 class="section-title">AGES OF THE PEOPLE.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">293.</h3>
				<p>With the exception of the inquiry as to the numbers and distribution of the people and that as to their occupations, the inquiry as to their ages is probably the most important made at the Census. It forms an essential item in statistical
						<span class="annotation"> [Ages of the people, Table XXXI, et seq.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_85"></div>
			<p>Calculations having reference to the health, wealth, and strength, as well as the progress or retrogression of a community, and affords a basis for the construction of national tables of life assurance.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">294.</h3>
				<p>This being the case, it is to be regretted that in many instances the inquiry is responded to incorrectly. In youth it not unfrequently happens that the age is overstated, in order, it is presumed, to enable young persons of both sexes to obtain situations which they would be considered not old enough to fill if their true age was given ; in middle age the tendency is the other way, and both men and women, whether from vanity or some other motive, very commonly understate their ages ; whilst in extreme old age there are instances of persons claiming to be nonogenarians or centenarians when they have lived many years less than the number which would entitle them to be placed in the ranks of those who have actually reached such ages.<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>For some years past the present writer has made it his business when a death has been registered in Victoria as at an age of 100 years or upwards to inquire of the relatives of the deceased as to whether there were good grounds for believing that such an advanced age had actually been reached, with the result that whilst in a few instances the particulars furnished appeared to be authentic, in most others the evidence of their correctness was insufficient, and in some the entry was admittedly wrong. In one case of a man being registered as having died aged 100, it was discovered his real age was only 84, and in another case when the age was set down as 101 it was found to have been actually only 91.</p>
					</div>By far the most serious of these disturbances to the correctness of the return is that which takes place at the middle period of life, when it invariably occurs that quite a number of persons who ought to know better either disregard or fail to recognize the impropriety of setting themselves down as younger than they really are.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">295.</h3>
				<p>It seems that persons who are unscrupulous enough to make a false statement of their age generally hesitate at passing over a quinquennial or decennial period, especially the latter ; as for instance, those whose age might really be 28 or 29 would return it as 25 ; and those whose age might really be 33 or 34 would return it as 30. For this reason it is always found that unnaturally large numbers of entries occur at the tens and the fives. To rectify this anomaly it is the common practice to tabulate the ages of a population in groups of five years, instead of in single years, and then to arrive at the probable ages by distributing the numbers into single years by a process of graduation. On this occasion the tabulation has been made both ways, which makes it possible to compare the ages as they were actually returned in the Householders' Schedules with the probably more correct numbers obtained by the graduating process referred to. The results of the two methods are placed side by side in the following table :—

			<p>NOTE.—Throughout the portion of this Report which relates to the Ages of the People, the adjusted age figures have been used, but in the parts relating to Education, Conjugal Condition, Sickness and Infirmity, and Occupations the figures taken from the Census Schedules have been those dealt with.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">296.</h3>
				<p>Proof of the untruthful manner in which many persons return their ages is afforded by an examination of the first columns of males and females, viz., those which show the numbers at each age according to the Census Schedules, when it will be noticed that larger numbers almost invariably occur at every fifth year from</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_87"></div>
			<p>15 onwards than at the year immediately preceding or immediately following it. Thus' whilst the number of males at 14 is 11,497, and that at 16 is 11,576, the number at 15 is larger than either, viz., 11,836 ; and whilst the number of females at 29 is 9,508, and that at 31 is 7,058, the number at 30 is as high as 10,526. These discrepancies are rectified in the second columns of males and females, the adjusted numbers in which—being in all probability the more correct—will be used in preference to the others throughout this portion of the Report.<div class="footnote">*

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">297.</h3>
				<p>It is evident that the Census of 1881 can afford no guide as to the probable numbers in 1891 under ten years of age, as all returned at that age at the latter period had been born since the Census of 1881 had been taken. The number of births in the decennium intervening between the Censuses must therefore be compared with the numbers under 10 in 1891 in order to ascertain whether there has been a gain or a loss. There having been, moreover, an interval of 10 years between those Censuses, it is evident that every person who lived would be 10 years older at the later than at the earlier one. As, however, some must have died at each age, and none of those born between the Census periods would be more than 10 years old in 1891, it follows that there would necessarily be a smaller number then than in 1881 at each period of life over 10, unless the places of those who died were supplied by immigrants. To show the gain by immigration or loss by emigration which occurred at each age, I have constructed a table in which the numbers in 1891 are placed side by side with those who were returned as 10 years younger in 1881, and the births between the Census periods are placed beside the numbers under 10 in 1891. The difference between the numbers in the two columns is then taken, to show the increase or decrease at each age, and the figures thus obtained are collated with those representing the deaths which have occurred during the decennium intervening between the Censuses ; the sum of the two, if there has been an increase, or the difference if a decrease, will then indicate the gain by excess of arrivals over departures or loss by the contrary which has taken place at each age during the 10 years. The following is the table in which this is shown, males and females being distinguished :—

				<span class="annotation"> [(1) Births in the interval between the Censuses of 1881 and 1891.] </span>
			
			<p>NOTE.—In this Table those whose ages were not specified in the Census Schedules have been distributed by proportion among the other numbers.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">298.</h3>
				<p>The sum of the numbers in 1881, and of the births which took place between then and the Census of 1891, expresses the whole number of persons to be accounted for, viz., 613,211 males and 563,670 females. As it is evident some will die, there must necessarily be a falling-off at each age, unless the numbers, are supplemented by immigration. A glance at the fifth column will show that the age periods at which the immigration was so great as to outnumber not only the deaths but also the emigration were all between 10 and 45 (0 and 35 in 1881) in the males, and all between 10 and 30 (0 and 20 in 1881) in the females, the excess of the former being 39,472, and of the latter 16,763. The sixth column shows the deaths at each period in the ten years, the difference between which and the numbers in the fifth column where the minus sign occurs or their sum where the plus sign occurs gives the numbers in the last column, which express the actual gain by excess of arrivals over departures or loss by excess of departures over arrivals at each period of age during the ten years.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">299.</h3>
				<p>It will be observed that the gain shown in the age period 0 to 10 (not born in 1881) is more than the gain in the two subsequent periods (10 to 20) combined in the case of the males, and nearly as much as that in those periods combined in the case of the females ; but this can scarcely have been caused by so many more infants being brought here than have been taken away, and it is probable that unregistered births are partly accountable for such large numbers. A loss of 597 males will be observed at 55 to 60 (45 to 50 in 1881), of 393 females at 30 to 35 (20 to 25 in 1881), and of 309 females at 55 to 60 (45 to 50 in 1881), a gain being shown at all the other periods.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">300.</h3>
				<p>The difference between the sum of the plus quantities and the sum of the minus quantities in the last column shows a net gain by immigration of 72,925 males and 43,435 females, which numbers agree as a matter of course with those quoted in a previous paragraph<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>See paragraph 55,<span class="emphasis">ante</span>.</p>

				<p>At the Census under review as compared with the previous one, fewer males were returned at each year of age from 41 to 54, and rather fewer females at each year from 43 to 46 ; but more males at all the other years up to 95, and more females—except at 42, when the numbers at the two Censuses were equal<div class="footnote">*

				<p>As the headings indicate, the first column of males and the first column of females show the excess of the numbers in 1891 over those in 1881, and the other two columns the opposite. The terms "excess" and "defect" are used in place of "increase" and "decrease," since the fact of there being higher numbers at one period than at a former one does not necessarily denote that an increase, or the contrary fact that a decrease, of population has taken place, as, if immigration and emigration be left out of account, the numbers at the latter period depend upon the numbers at quite another age at a former one. It will be observed that the principal ages at which the numbers at the later period exceeded those at the former were—males, all the years from 0 to 40 and from 55 to 95 ; females, all the years from 0 to 41 and 47 to 93 ; and the principal ages at which the numbers in 1891 were less than those in 1881 were—males, the years from 41 to 54 ; females, the years from 43 to 46. The whole defect being deducted from the whole excess, the net excess at all ages of males is shown to have been 146,331, and of females 131,728, as has been already stated.<div class="footnote">†

				<p>A popular division of life at the present time is into four periods, viz., Infancy, Youth, Manhood or Womanhood, and Old Age ; but these may, with greater accuracy, be extended to seven distinct periods or ages, varying but little, so far as the male human being is concerned, from the "Seven Ages" so eloquently described by Shakspeare in the celebrated lines set down by him as having been uttered by the melancholy Jaques.<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>" As You Like It," Act 2, scene 7.</p>
					</div>Each of these periods is marked by some change which ordinarily takes place in the human body and constitution. The first period, Infancy, is that from birth to the time the first dentition has been completed, which is generally about the end of the 2nd year ; the second period, Childhood, is marked by the dropping out of the middle incisors and the appearance of a second set—it extends from the 3rd to the end of the 7th year ; the third period, Boyhood or Girlhood, in which all the first or milk set of teeth are replaced by permanent ones, extends from the 8th to the end of the 14th year ; the fourth period, Adolescence, also called Youth or Puberty, is marked by the development of the generative system, and, although commencing somewhat earlier in the female than the male, may be said, in both cases, to extend from about the 15th to the 21st year ; the fifth period, Manhood or Womanhood, is that in which the body attains its full height and strength, the intellect is matured, the "wisdom teeth" are cut, marriage is contracted, and the family is formed ; it extends from the 22nd to about the 50th year. At the latter period the woman becomes incapable of bearing children, and her constitution undergoes a complete change ; such a change, although in a less marked degree, is also noticeable in the constitution of the man ; the sixth period may be called Mature Age, in which, whilst the strength of intellect usually continues undiminished, the body has often a tendency to obesity ; this period extends from the 50th to the 65th year ; the seventh period, Old Age, the "last scene of all, which ends this strange eventful history," extends from the 65th year to the end of life. In it the muscles become weak and flaccid, and, not being able to sustain the weight of the body, allow it to stoop more or less ; the hair becomes white ; the teeth drop out ; the senses are dulled ; the intellect is enfeebled ; the memory fails ; the circulation weakens ; the curtain falls.

				<p>There are certain steps or stages in human life which from very early times have been considered critical in the sense that, at each of them, it was believed that a remarkable change was likely to take place in health, life, or fortune.

				<p>It may not be uninteresting to mention that, according to a life table constructed by Mr. A. F.

Mr. Burridge did not publish a table for females in Victoria separately, but he gave a table for Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland combined, according to which the "expectation of life" in the three colonies is 46.47 years for males and 49.64 years for females.<div class="footnote">† 
						<p>See<span class="emphasis">Journal of the Institute of Actuaries</span>, Volume XXIV., page 351. Prior to this (see Volume XXIII., page 325) Mr. Burridge published a table for both sexes in Victoria, based upon the results of the year 1879. According to this table, the "expectation of life" in this colony is 49.20 years for males and 52.33 years for females. Too much reliance, however, should not be placed on these figures, as they are founded upon the experience of only one year.</p>
					</div>In England and Wales, according to the most recent life table, the "expectation of life" is 41.92 years for males and 45.25 years for females, so that, if the figures relating to the two countries hold good, an Australian male may expect to live 4.55 years longer than an Englishman, and an Australian female 4.39 years longer than an Englishwoman.

The proportion at this period of life, as compared with the whole female population, was observed to have fallen off greatly in 1871 as compared with 1861 ; but as the youthful female population have grown to womanhood the proportion has again increased, and in 1881 was 159 per 10,000 higher than in 1871, whilst in 1891 it was 306 higher than in 1881. It had not, however, reached so high by 281 per 10,000 as the proportion in 1861, that being a period at which, although the stream of immigration which had been attracted to Victoria by the fame of the gold-fields had ceased, its expanding influence upon the ranks of the adult population continued to be felt.

In 1861 there were 168,000 men at that age, but in consequence of the decline in the gold yield, as well as from the fact of a large proportion of the adult male population of the colony being drawn away in order to avail themselves of the facilities offered by several of the neighbouring colonies for taking up land on easy terms, also in consequence of an insufficient number of boys and youths growing up to take the places of the adult males as the latter, who formed the main portion of the immigrants to the early gold-fields, became older or died, the number had fallen off to 125,000 by 1871, and to as low as 114,000 by 1881. By 1891, however, the number had again risen and amounted to 206,000, or 38,000 more than in 1861 ; but the proportion to the total population of the colony, although higher than in 1881 or 1871, was still much below that in 1861, as is shown by the following figures :—

				<p>It is evident that a population which, relatively to the total number of units of which it is composed, contains a great many children and very old people is not so physically effective as one which has a larger proportion of persons at the middle period of life. Speaking generally, it may be said that persons between 15 and 65 years of age are able to contribute largely to their own maintenance, and often to support themselves altogether, whilst those under 15 and over 65 are supported by others. Upon this principle the Victorian population was relatively somewhat stronger in 1881 and much stronger in 1891 than in 1871, although it was not at any of those periods nearly so strong as in 1861 ; this will be seen by means of the following figures, which show the numbers in every 10,000 living at the supporting and dependent ages at the four periods :—

			<h1 class="section-title">EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">345.</h3>
				<p>Soon after the first settlement of Victoria—then the Port Phillip District of New South Wales—the desirability of providing primary instruction for the rising generation engaged the attention of the colonists. An agitation was set on foot to introduce a State system of education ; this being, however, unsuccessful, the matter was for some years left to private enterprise, but in 1848 a Denominational system of education was established under the authority of the then Governor of New South Wales. A board was appointed to administer this system, and a subsidy was granted
						<span class="annotation"> [Education, Table XXXIX. et seq.] </span>
					
						<span class="annotation"> [State education.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_104"></div>
			<p>by the State. Religious as well as secular instruction was imparted by the teacher, the former being given according to the principles of the denomination to which the school was attached, the clergy of which also exercised control over the tenets to be taught. A national system of education had been in force in New South Wales for some years before the separation from it of Port Phillip, but, it appears, had not extended to the latter. On the erection, however, of the Port Phillip District into a separate colony under the name of Victoria, a Board of National Education was appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor "for the formation and management of schools to be conducted under Lord Stanley's National System of Education, and for administering the funds voted in connexion therewith." This action of the Lieutenant-Governor was legalized by an Act passed on the 31st December, 1851, entitled "An Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners of National Education" (15 Vict. No. 7). There were thus two State systems of education under separate boards in operation in Victoria at the same time. The duplicate system continued to exist until 1862, when, it being found to be cumbrous and costly, it was abolished under "The Common Schools Act" (25 Vict. No. 149). This Act, which came into force on the 1st September, 1862, transferred the powers of the Denominational and National Boards to a single Board of Education, provided a limit to the distance between which schools might be established, and fixed a minimum of scholars a school must have in order to entitle it to receive State aid ; it prescribed, moreover, that four hours each day should be set apart for secular instruction, and that no child should be refused admission to any school on account of its religious persuasion. Although this Act caused some improvement it did not abolish denominationalism, nor did it reduce the number of small schools to any appreciable extent. It continued in force, however, for ten years, when it was repealed by the<span class="emphasis">Education Act</span>1872 (36 Vict. No. 447), which came into operation on the 1st January, 1873. Prior to this, a free ranging from 6d. to 2s. 6d. weekly was charged to all children except those whose parents were in destitute circumstances, but under the new Act, which, after being amended and consolidated, is still in force as regards its main principles, education was made free to all willing to accept it, compulsory in the sense that, whether accepted or not, evidence must be produced that all children are educated up to a certain standard ; and secular, no teacher being allowed to give other than secular instruction in any State school building, which instruction he must give for at least four hours on each school day. Under this Act a number of small schools have been closed, and buildings of size suitable to the requirements of each district have been erected in all parts of the colony. The system, which, in consequence of the exclusion of religious teaching, is not accepted by the heads of the Roman Catholic denomination, has given satisfaction to other sections of the community, and without doubt has been productive of excellent results.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">346.</h3>
				<p>In addition to the State schools, there are a number of private schools established in different parts of the colony. Some of these are collegiate or grammar schools, and in establishments of this description a superior class of instruction is imparted.
						<span class="annotation"> [Private schools.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">347.</h3>
				<p>The Melbourne University was opened on the 3rd October, 1855. The Government subsidy to that institution, which was then £9,000, amounted in 1891 to £16,000 per annum. No religious test is administered to any one to entitle him to be admitted to the rights and privileges of the institution. The Council is empowered to grant in any faculty, except divinity, any degree, diploma, certificate, or licence which
						<span class="annotation"> [University.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_105"></div>
			<p>can be conferred by any University in the British dominions, and, by Royal letters patent, the degrees granted are equal to those granted by any University in the United Kingdom. In the Act of incorporation, provision was made for the establishment of affiliated colleges in connexion with the four principal religious denominations, and ground for the erection of such colleges was reserved near the University. Up to the present period this privilege has been taken advantage of by the Anglicans, Presbyterians, and Wesleyans ; their colleges being named respectively Trinity, Ormond, and Queen's. The Roman Catholics have not yet commenced to erect a college on the site reserved for their body.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">348.</h3>
				<p>With such facilities for obtaining education as exist in Victoria it may reasonably be expected that in the course of a few years it will be taken for granted that every individual in the colony of a sufficient age to have received instruction is at any rate possessed of the rudimentary arts of reading and writing, which are the only attainments respecting which the inquiry is made at the Census ; and that such inquiry will, in consequence, be allowed to drop out of the Census schedule.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">349.</h3>
				<p>On the householders' schedules special columns were provided for the purpose of ascertaining not only the number of the children receiving education, but whether they were being educated at State schools, at private schools, or at home. Entries in these columns were made in 214,259 instances, but in 12,935 instances the columns were ignored, and the word "scholar" was written in the occupation column without any reference being made to the nature of the institution in which instruction was being imparted.

				<p>It may be supposed that the Census figures give an account of the children actually attending school at the time of the Census, whilst the returns of individual scholars made up by the State and private school authorities give the numbers attending school for ever so short a time in the year, inasmuch as, according to the Census of 1891, the number of State school scholars was less than the published estimate for 1890<div class="footnote">*

				<p>The age in Victoria at which parents are required by law to cause their children to be receiving education, unless there be some valid reason to prevent them from so doing, is from 6 to 13 years (school age). According to the following figures, the Census returns give the number being educated between these ages as 15,013, or 8.66 per cent. below the total number at the same ages in the colony :—

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">354.</h3>
				<p>It should be pointed out that it does not follow that the 15,000 children referred to as not receiving education at the date of the Census were altogether neglected. Some of them, no doubt, pursued study at other portions of the year, and some had, it is known, already attained the standard of efficiency prescribed by the regulations. It is, moreover, possible that some children engaged in selling newspapers, carrying milk, minding cattle, or following some other occupations during the morning and evening, may have been returned as of those occupations instead of as attending school, which they might also have been doing during the regulation hours. This would obviously have the effect of causing an understatement of the number of scholars in the Census returns.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">355.</h3>
				<p>It will be observed that more boys than girls attended State schools, and this was also the case amongst the scholars respecting whom the source of instruction was not stated, which points to the probability of the majority of them being also attendants at State schools. On the other hand, amongst the scholars attending private schools and those being educated at home, the number of girls exceeded that of boys.

				<p>Whilst, according to the table, there were more boys than girls being educated at and below the school age, above the school age the reverse was the case, the reason of the latter no doubt being that, whilst boys have, as a rule, to go out into the world as soon as possible after the compulsory education age is passed in order to earn their livelihood, most girls have leisure to pursue their studies to a still later period.</p>

				<p>In dealing with the returns under this head of inquiry, the Chinese and Aborigines are not tabulated with the population of European birth or extraction, but their attainments in the matter of reading and writing are given in separate tables. The Chinese are not considered as able to read and write unless they can do so in the English language ; the reason of this is given in the subjoined extract from my Report upon the Census of 1881<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>Pages 68 and 69.</p>

			<p>"Probably most of the Chinese acquire some proficiency in reading and writing their own language, but as the characters in it number, it is said, at least 40,000 (words not being built up of letters as in our own system, but each character standing for a word), and as the ability to decipher and form a few of these characters is probably attained by almost every Chinese during the course of his life-time, whereas a perfect knowledge of every character in the language is rarely if ever gained even by the most advanced scholars, it is difficult to say where the ability of a Chinaman to read and write begins and where it ends— how many characters it is necessary for him to know and be able to make before he could be stated to be instructed, or how few would warrant his being classed as illiterate. This being the case, and considering also that a knowledge of a certain number of the characters of their own language would but slightly, if at all, add to their usefulness as citizens of this community, I was instrumental in causing a short instruction to be inserted at the head of the Education column of the Householder's Schedule used at the Census of 1871, to the effect that the Chinese not able to read or write English should be set down as illiterate. This was noticed with approval in the other Australasian Colonies, and on the occasion of the present Census a similar instruction was embodied in the schedule of almost every colony of the group. As, however, such a number of illiterate adults would give a false view of the educational state of the community, I have had tables prepared excluding them as well as the Aborigines from the numbers, and shall, in the present portion of my Report, treat of the population exclusive of the members of those two races."</p>

				<p>Omitting the Chinese and Aborigines, the persons returned as able to read numbered 940,286, of whom 907,588 could also write, whilst those unable to read numbered 190,177. The population dealt with being 1,130,463, it follows that 83 per cent. of that number could read, 80 per cent. could also write, and 17 per cent. were unable to read.

				<p>According to the present returns, girls before they arrive at the school age appear to be less able to receive instruction than boys, as the proportions of the latter able to read and able to write are higher than those of the former. The returns of 1881 show an opposite result, a larger proportion of girls than boys being then set down as able to read and also to write. Some doubt, however, exists as to the reliability of the information given respecting the acquirements of very young children.</p>

				<p>The term "adult" admits of several interpretations. In Victoria, an immigrant or emigrant is officially classed as an adult if over 12 years of age ; in the United Kingdom, the term is commonly applied to persons over 21, although sometimes it has been used in regard to persons of 18 and upwards. In some other countries it is only used in reference to persons over 25. In respect to the ability to read and write, however, the designation may be fairly considered applicable to persons aged 15 and upwards, who, if they have not already mastered those arts, will probably never do so. Adopting this, then, as the adult age, the number of either sex returned as able to read, able to write, or unable to do either was as follows in 1891 :—

				<p>By comparing the proportions for 1881 with those for 1891, it is made evident that in the case of both men and women primary education had become more extensively spread at the latter period than it was at the former. A comparison of the figures for 1891, however, with those in the previous table will show that males</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_113"></div>
			<p>and females of 15 and upwards were more generally educated than those of 21 and upwards, thereby proving that the standard of education in the former was raised by the nearer approach to universal education existing amongst those between 15 and 21.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">380.</h3>
				<p>At both periods, education amongst males of 21 and upwards was more common than amongst females at the same period of life, which is more especially apparent in the matter of writing. At the school age, in 1891, girls were more generally educated than boys, as has been already mentioned. At the same period it was found that at all ages between 15 and 40, females are more commonly educated than males, but from 40 onwards, education was more widely diffused amongst men than amongst women.

				<p>It has been considered possible that the Census return of adult education may not be absolutely reliable, as a very small amount of rudimentary instruction, quite insufficient to enable its possessor to make use of it in the smallest business relations of life may cause him to feel justified in stating, or may cause others to feel justified in stating for him, that he is able to read and write. It has, therefore, been thought that a more certain test is afforded by the marriage register, on which all males and all females entering the marriage state are required to affix their signatures in writing, if they are able to write ; if not, by means of a mark or cross.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">383.</h3>
				<p>The practical test of signature to the marriage register gives for both years a much larger proportion of men and women able to write than the Census returns. This was to be expected, as whilst but few old people—amongst whom the uneducated are chiefly found—contract marriage, a considerable number of those who marry (especially the females) are under 21 years of age, at which period of life the great majority of both sexes can write. A considerable improvement in 1891 as compared with 1881 is indicated both by the Census and the registers ; it will, more-over, be remarked that the difference between the results arrived at by means of the two tests is much less at the later than at the earlier period.</p>

				<p>Until 1881 all the denominations showed satisfactory improvement under each head from Census to Census, but as compared with that year there was a general falling off in 1891. This is especially marked in regard to the proportions able to read, under which head the figures relating to every one of the denominations were smaller in 1891 than in 1881. As regards those able to write, advancement is shown in the returns of the principal denominations, but retrogression in those of the Baptists, Lutherans, Unitarians, Other Protestants, and Jews.</p>

				<p>If the denominations be arranged according to the proportions in which the children of each of them, in 1891, could read and could write, as in the following lists, it is found that, in regard to both these subjects, Jews are at the head. Protestants, as a whole, stand fifth on the lists ; Presbyterians, Methodists, and Independents being above them. Roman Catholics occupy the sixth place in regard to the ability to read, being above Baptists and members of the Church of England, who stand seventh and eighth ; but, in regard to the ability to write, Roman Catholics fall to the eighth position, Baptists and members of the Church of England rising above them to the sixth and seventh places. It will be remembered that the Roman Catholics do not, as a rule, avail themselves of the free education offered by the State ; but the position of their children on the lists, especially in regard to the ability to read, indicates that efficient rudimentary instruction is afforded in the schools supported by the voluntary effort of their own body :—</p>

The arrangement is according to the numbers able to read, but were it according to those able to write Tasmania and Queensland would change places, for whilst the proportion of readers is greater in the former, that of writers is greater in the latter.</p>

				<p>According to this test, Victoria stands above any of the other Australasian Colonies in regard to adult education, New Zealand sinking to the second place. In consequence of the relatively small number of old people marrying, and the fact that the rising generation who do marry is more generally instructed than the generation which is passing away, all the colonies show a larger proportion of educated adults according to the marriage registers than they do according to the Census returns. In the following table the figures indicated by the two methods are placed side by side :—</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">402.</h3>
				<p>It will be noticed that the difference between the Census test of adult education and that afforded by the marriage registers, is least in New Zealand, and next in Victoria ; the greatest difference being in Queensland. The differences appear to run inversely to the degree in which education is most uniformly distributed over all the adult ages, and thus stand in an opposite direction to that occupied by the Census figures relating to the different colonies.</p>

Under the new Act the following grounds of divorce have been added to those previously existing :—</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">415.</h3>
				<p>Having some regard to the dictates of common sense and the teachings of physiology, the law does not permit boys and girls to marry until they have attained the still much too early ages of 14 and 12 respectively, even if their parents should be so foolishly blind, or wickedly careless of their children's interests, as to consent to their doing so. The boys and girls under these ages numbered respectively 188,114 and 160,860, and the number of males and females at all ages being 598,414 and 541,991, it follows that 32 per cent. of the former and 30 per cent. of the latter had not arrived at the age to contract marriage legally.
						<span class="annotation"> [Numbers under marriageable age.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">416.</h3>
				<p>At a lawful age to marry, males numbered 410,300, females 381,131, and of these 171,050 males and 173,848 females were living in the marriage state ; 18,596 males and 32,916 females were living in a state of widowhood ; and 110 males and 86 females were living in a state of divorce. Deducting these from the first totals, it will be found that the number legally entitled to marry but who had never been married was—of males, 220,544 ; of females, 174,281, or 54 and 46 per cent. respectively of those at legally marriageable ages.
						<span class="annotation"> [Numbers at marriageable age.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">417.</h3>
				<p>But of those who in point of age are legally entitled to marry, very few males actually marry before the age of 20, and scarcely any females before the age of 15. These, then, are generally considered to be the periods at which bachelorhood and spinsterhood commence. Adopting these designations in respect to the never married of both sexes at and above the ages named, there were in the colony when the Census was taken 152,036 bachelors and 140,297 spinsters.
						<span class="annotation"> [Bachelors and spinsters.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">418.</h3>
				<p>These numbers include the Chinese and Aborigines, but as persons of these races can hardly be considered to add to the marriageable strength of the community, they will be deducted in all cases having reference to single men and women, leaving 144,457 bachelors and 140,154 spinsters. If to these be added the widowed and divorced of both sexes, it will be found that the marriageable males numbered 163,048, and the marriageable females 173,138.
						<span class="annotation"> [Marriageable men and women.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">419.</h3>
				<p>The marriageable females, it will be observed, outnumber the marriageable males, but it must be remembered that the marriageable age of females has been held to commence five years earlier than that of males. Should it be considered to commence at the same period for both sexes, the marriageable males would be found to largely outnumber the marriageable females.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">420.</h3>
				<p>At each of the four Census periods which preceded the Census of 1881, the marriageable men largely exceeded the marriageable women, but in 1881 the latter were found to be the more numerous by 20,000, and in 1891 by 10,000. The following</p>

				<p>The marriageable men increased in numbers until 1861, but ten years later they had fallen off by 17,000. Since then they have increased regularly from Census to Census, but they did not reach the number returned in 1861 until 1891, when they exceeded it by 56,000. There was, however, a steady increase in the number of marriageable women during each intercensal period.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">422.</h3>
				<p>The frequency of marriage, although doubtless affected favorably by the prosperity or adversely by the depression prevailing in the community, seems to depend mainly upon the number of marriageable men, and to be but little, if at all, influence by that of marriageable women being plentiful or the contrary. Of course there must be a sufficient number of the latter or there would be but few marriages ; but the fact of their being a large number available does not appear to raise, nor that of there being only a small number available to lower the marriage rate. To demonstrate this the following table has been constructed showing the proportion of marriages to the population, to the number of single men, and to the number of single women in each of the six Census years ended with 1891 :—

				<p>It will be noticed that in 1854, when there were only 21 single women to every 100 single men<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>See Table following paragraph 420,<span class="emphasis">ante.</span></p>
					</div>(the lowest proportion reached), nearly 25 per cent. of the former (the highest proportion reached) were married in the year, and the proportion</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_123"></div>
			<p>of marriages to the whole population was also much higher than it has been since, whilst in 1881, when there were as many as 120 single women to every 100 single men<div class="footnote">* 
					<p>* See Table following paragraph 420,<span class="emphasis">ante.</span>—</p>
				</div>(the highest proportion reached), less than 5 per cent. of the former (the lowest proportion reached) were married in the year, and the proportion to the population was almost the lowest in any of the years shown. It will, moreover, be noticed that during the 37 years over which the statement extends, whilst the proportion of marriages to the population and to the marriageable women has fluctuated considerably, the proportion to the marriageable men has remained tolerably constant, the extremes being 57 per cent. in 1881, and 42 per cent. in 1861. At the last three decennial periods, when the colony was in a more settled condition than at the earlier periods, this proportion averaged 55 per 1,000, which was also the rate in 1891. At the same periods the proportion of marriages per 1,000 marriageable women varied from 72 in 1871 to 48 in 1881. The reduction in 1891 as compared with 1881 in the proportion of marriages to the available men has probably arisen from the circumstance that the colony was in a less prosperous state at the latter period than at the former.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">424.</h3>
				<p>The returns for 1891 show a smaller number of marriageable females than marriageable males at each of the quinquennial periods of age at which they jointly occur. The reason of the whole number of the former being greater than that of the latter is—as already stated<div class="footnote">† 
						<p>See paragraph 419,<span class="emphasis">ante.</span></p>
					</div>;—that, in consequence of the ages at which marriages are found to take place, the marriageable age of spinsters is assumed to commence at an earlier period of life (15 years) than that of bachelors (20 years), which gives an addition of 55,983 to the former. Were 20 to be assumed to be the commencement of spinsterhood in females, as it is of bachelorhood in males, the marriageable females would number only 117,155, or 45,893 less than the marriageable males.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">425.</h3>
				<p>Of every 100 men of the age of 20 and upwards 43 were bachelors ; and there were 49 available for marriage, being either bachelors, widowers, or divorced.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">426.</h3>
				<p>Of every 100 women of the age of 20 and upwards 29 were spinsters ; and there were 41 available for marriage, being either spinsters, widows, or divorced.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">428.</h3>
				<p>Men in towns desiring to marry have, as may be supposed, a wider field wherefrom to select their partners than men living in the country, inasmuch as in town districts (cities, towns, and boroughs) marriageable women exceeded marriageable men by 26,480, whilst in country districts (shires) marriageable men were the more numerous by 15,515.
						<span class="annotation"> [Marriageable persons in town and country.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">429.</h3>
				<p>Of every 100 males of 20 and upwards, 46 of those living in towns and 52 of those living in the country were marriageable ; and of every 100 females of 15 and upwards, 51 of those living in towns and 48 of those living in the country were marriageable.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">430.</h3>
				<p>The legitimate births which took place during the twelve months of which the Census was the middle numbered 35,853, or 297 to every 1,000 married women under 45 years of age. The women available for marriage under that age and over 15 numbered 142,337. If all these had been married, the births in the year would probably have amounted to 78,127, or 42,274 more than they actually did.

				<p>Men and women marry at all ages ; still, if they do not enter into the marriage state until they have become somewhat advanced in years, they are styled old bachelors and old maids. There seems to be no definite period of life at which these designations begin to be applied, but there is no doubt that the term " old maid " is used in regard to women at an earlier age than that at which the term " old bachelor " is used in regard to men. If 40 and 30 respectively be assumed to be the ages at which men and women who have never married become old bachelors and old maids, there were in the colony when the Census was taken 24,089 of the former and 19,879 of the latter ; but if the distinction be not conferred on unmarried men until they have attained the age of 50 or on unmarried women until they have attained the age of 40, there were in the colony 14,865 old bachelors and 7,042 old maids.
						<span class="annotation"> [Old bachelors and old maids.] </span>

				<p>Including Chinese and Aborigines, the number of men returned as husbands in 1891 was 171,050, and the number of women returned as wives was 173,848. There must thus have been at least 2,798 married women living in Victoria whose husbands were absent from the colony.
						<span class="annotation"> [Husbands and wives.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">433.</h3>
				<p>As against the last-mentioned number, there was an excess of wives over husbands amounting to 1,388 in 1881, but to only 133 in 1871 ; whilst in 1861 there was an excess of husbands over wives amounting to 4,290.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">434.</h3>
				<p>Except at the age of 15, when there were 10 husbands to only 6 wives, wives in 1891 exceeded husbands at every age-period up to 35, the total excess being 23,491 ; but after 35 years of age husbands exceeded wives at every quinquennial period of age, the total excess being 20,689.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">435.</h3>
				<p>Although throughout the colony the number of husbands did not differ greatly from that of wives, it does not follow that the husbands all belonged to the wives, or all the wives to the husbands. Of the 171,050 husbands and 173,848 wives returned, only 154,544 of each abode in the same house on the Census night ; thus the husbands whose wives were absent numbered 16,506, and the wives whose husbands were absent numbered 19,304. The difference between the absent husbands and absent wives was of course the same as that between the whole number of husbands and the whole number of wives, viz., 2,798, as already stated.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">436.</h3>
				<p>The proportion of husbands whose wives were absent was somewhat smaller, whilst the proportion of wives whose husbands were absent was somewhat larger, on the Census night of 1891 than on that of 1881, 1871, or 1861.

				<p>It must be admitted that there is considerable doubt as to the actual existence of so many married persons—especially males—at the very early ages named. They were so set down in the Census schedules, but it is possible that, in some instances, persons may have been so foolish and so regardless of propriety as—perhaps in jest—either to understate the age of the young persons referred to or to enter them as married when they were not so. This is borne out by the fact that in the ten years ended with 1890 no male married in Victoria at an earlier age than 16 years, and no female at an earlier age than 14 years.

				<p>It will be observed that in the last year named in the table, which is that preceding the Census year, no male was married at any age under 17 years, and only 3 at that age, and no female was married at any age under 15 years. So, unless the husbands returned at the Census as being 14, 15, and 16 years of age and the majority of those returned as being 17 years of age, as well as the wives returned as being 13 and 14 years of age, came to the colony after being married elsewhere, which is very unlikely, it must necessarily follow that the Census returns are, in this particular, incorrect.</p>

				<p>Husbands under 21 years of age were in the proportion of 16 to every 10,000 husbands of all ages, or about 1 in 620.

Applying the same proportions to the married couples, numbering 154,444, who abode in the same house on the night of the Census of 1891, it would follow that in 49,422 instances the husband and wife were about the same age, in 92,666 instances the husband was older than the wife, and in 12,356 instances the wife was older than the husband.</p>

				<p>In order to ascertain the fruitfulness of the women of a country, it is usual to compare the legitimate births with the number of married women at the child-bearing age, which may be assumed to include all who have not passed their 45th year. Comparing the births with the total population, which is the ordinary means resorted to for the purpose of obtaining a knowledge of the reproductive strength of a community, is likely to mislead, as the population of different countries, or of the same country at different periods, varies considerably in regard to the sexes, ages, and conjugal condition of those forming its component parts. In the following table the legitimate births which took place in the periods of 12 months of which the last three Census days were the middle are compared with the numbers of the population and of the married women at the reproductive period of life, as returned at the three Censuses referred to :—

				<p>It will be noticed that although the proportion of legitimate births per 1,000 of the population fluctuated considerably at the three periods, the proportion per 1,000 of the married women at reproductive ages remained tolerably uniform, being 297 per 1,000 in 1891 as compared with 302[FORMULA] per 1,000 at each of the two former periods. The increase in the birth rate calculated in the ordinary way, since 1881, is therefore found to be due merely to an increase in the proportion of married women in the community at the fruitful period of life.</p>

				<p>The figures show a steady diminution in the proportion of children born, amounting—not withstanding a slight revival in 1887 and 1888—in the eighteen years to an average of a child and a quarter per marriage, or five children to every four marriages. It is evident that if the births increased with the marriages as they should do the proportions would remain steady ; but this is shown not to be the case. There are, however, many matters affecting the birth rates of infants respecting which it is not possible to obtain precise information. The falling-off shown by the figures in the last column of the table is a result which, although perhaps it cannot be proved, may be conjectured to be owing to the increasing desire on the part of married women to evade the cares of maternity, and the steps taken by them to prevent its occurrence.</p>

				<p>Supposing the distinction between children born in and out of wedlock to be correctly stated in the birth registers, it would be possible to ascertain approximately what number of single women were living in concubinage, the assumption being that the illegitimate births would bear the same proportion to such single women that the legitimate births do to the married women at the reproductive period of life. Statistics of illegitimacy are, however, always more or less unreliable. The very natural desire of a woman to conceal her shame and protect her offspring from the legal and social disabilities attending illegitimate birth may, and no doubt often does, impel her when registering her child's birth to keep back the fact of its having been born out of wedlock. It is certain that illegitimacy is always as rife as the returns indicate, but how much more so it may be there are no means of ascertaining.

				<p>In Victoria, as in most other civilized countries, very complete mortality statistics are published annually, but it is only when a Census is taken that it is possible to obtain a knowledge of the amount of disablement arising from sickness and accidents, and the extent to which deaf-muteism, blindness, insanity, and other ailments of a chronic or permanent character prevail in the community.

				<p>The importance of such an inquiry is evident. The actuarial calculations made for the guidance of Friendly Societies, which afford the only sound basis for the operations of those bodies—in the prosperity and security of which the interests of so large a proportion of the population are involved—are founded upon results such as those which are obtained under this head of inquiry. It may reasonably be supposed, moreover, that the details placed on record will have the effect of exciting the practical sympathies of benevolent persons towards those who, by their infirmities, are precluded, either wholly or partially, from taking an active part in the affairs of life.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">511.</h3>
				<p>The total number of persons returned as suffering from infirmity at the date of the Census of 1891 was 23,916, viz., 14,675 males and 9,241 females.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">514.</h3>
				<p>The infirmities are of two classes :—(1) Those causing total disablement for the time being, but from which it is probable complete recovery might take place sooner or later ; (2) those of a permanent character, but which would not generally prevent the sufferer from engaging in some kind of bread-winning occupation. Besides these, some persons were returned as suffering from ailments of a minor description, which in a few instances have been considered of sufficient importance to be mentioned in the tables whilst in others they have been entirely disregarded.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">517.</h3>
				<p>In 1881 all the proportions were higher than these. Per 10,000 of each living there were then 169 disabled persons, or 1 in 59 ; 189 disabled males, or 1 in 53 ; 147 disabled females, or 1 in 68.<div class="footnote">†

				<p>It will be easily realized that the community sustains considerable loss as well as inconvenience in consequence of some portion of its component parts being always laid up on account of illness or bodily injury. Of those so affected, the children are obliged to discontinue their studies, the men their work or business, and the women their household duties as long as the disablement lasts. Taking the sick and those suffering from accidents together, there were on the Census day 14,592 persons—viz., 8,969 males and 5,623 females—in a disabled condition. Supposing the Census day to have been an average one as regards the amount of infirmity prevailing, there would obviously in one year be an amount of work lost from this cause equal to that of 1 person for 14,592 years, or of 1 male for 8,969 years and of 1</p>

This is altogether irrespective of the loss occasioned by illnesses of a slight or partial character, not serious enough to cause work to be altogether discontinued, which according to instructions were not to be returned, or of the loss to others occasioned by attendance on sick persons, or by reason of deaf-muteism, blindness, lunacy, &amp;c.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">519.</h3>
				<p>A consideration of these figures will show that, irrespective of the distress, destitution, and mental suffering occurring amongst families by reason of the deaths of their members, the outbreak of every epidemic disease which visits a country must seriously affect its material wealth and prosperity, and therefore that, on economic as well as on moral grounds, those who promote and enforce sanitary laws and regulations are deserving of high commendation and support.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">520.</h3>
				<p>According to the figures, the average number of days' disabling infirmity in the course of one year experienced by each person in the community is 4.67, or 5.47 days by each male, and 3.79 days by each female.

				<p>Relatively to the numbers living, the amount of sickness experienced by both males and females increased at every period of age, with the no doubt accidental exceptions of that between 25 and 30 years in the case of both sexes, and of that between 45 and 50 in the case of females—the increases at the later periods being very striking ; cases of accident also increased with somewhat less steadiness amongst males up to 80 years of age, and amongst females to the end of life. As the chance of meeting with an accident is not so great in old age as in middle age and youth, it is probable that many of the accidents from which old people were reported to be suffering were received by them at earlier periods of life, the effects being still felt in old age.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">523.</h3>
				<p>In proportion to their respective numbers more boys than girls were sick up to 5 years of age ; from 5 to 20 the numbers sick of the two sexes were about equal, but from 20 to 45, embracing the child-bearing period of female life, more women were sick than men. From 45 to the end of life sick men were relatively more numerous than sick women. The proportion of males suffering from accidents was much larger than that of females at each quinquennial age period up to 80, after which it so happened that the proportion of females suffering from accidents was in excess of that of males.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">524.</h3>
				<p>The following important facts, elicited from the returns, should be taken special note of by those who guide the operations of Friendly Societies, who, in view of them, will at once recognise the desirability of encouraging young men to join their ranks, and the absolute necessity, if they are to remain solvent, of accumulating funds before the members advance in life. The Census day being accepted as a normal one in point of the illness prevailing, the figures show that in this colony men between 20 and 30 years are liable to be laid up by reason of sickness or accident for something less than 3, and men between 30 and 40 for about 3¾ working days in the year ; whereas men between 40 and 50 would probably be laid up for 5¼ working days in the year, men between 50 and 60 for 9¼ such days, men between 60 and 70 for 17¼ such days, and men of 70 and upwards for 42¾ such days.
						<span class="annotation"> [Liability to disablement annually.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">525.</h3>
				<p>The average number of working days for which members of Friendly Societies received sick pay in 1891 was 10.45. Assuming the Census day to have been a normal one in point of the prevalence of illness, the average number of such days during which men of 20 years and upwards might expect to be laid up in twelve months would be 7.05. The period of sickness for which payment was claimed by members of Friendly Societies was thus considerably higher than that experienced by the male portion of the general population living at the period of life named, although the average age of members of Friendly Societies was almost identical with that of the men living at that period ; whence it follows that members of Friendly Societies were disabled for a longer time than might have been expected from the results of the Census. This result, however, is the reverse of that experienced in 1881, when the Census gave 9.3 working days as the period of disablement which might be expected during the year for men of 20 and upwards, or a day and a half more than the time for which sick pay was claimed by members of Friendly Societies in that year.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">526.</h3>
				<p>It is probable that sick pay is in many cases allowed by Friendly Societies to paralyzed persons, as well as to those suffering from ordinary illness, but even if such persons (returned separately at the Census) be added to the sick and injured,</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_146"></div>
			<p>the number of working days' disablement experienced according to the Census by men aged 20 and upwards (7.58) would be found to be much less than the average number of days' sick pay disbursed by Friendly Societies in 1891.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">527.</h3>
				<p>Calculations as to the average number of days' disablement experienced annually at various ages by members of Friendly Societies in England have been made from time to time by several actuaries, who have studied the working of those bodies ; and Mr. E. F. Owen, A. I. A., the Actuary for Friendly Societies attached to the Office of the Government Statist, Melbourne, has made similar calculations respecting the Manchester Unity I. O. O. F. in Victoria. In the following table Mr. Owen's calculations, as well as those relating to three English Friendly Societies, are collated with figures showing the days of disablement which would be experienced in Victoria, supposing the Census days of 1881 and 1891 to have been normal ones in regard to the amount of disabling illness prevailing. The figures relate to males only :—

				<p>Widely different results are shown by the respective computations. The days of disablement derived from calculations based upon the Census day of 1891 are fewer than those upon that of 1881 at all the ages except 20 to 25, but the figures in both these columns show a much smaller amount of disablement than do those in any of the columns relating to Friendly Societies. In regard to these, the figures relating to the Manchester Unity in Victoria show a larger amount of disablement than those relating to any of the English societies except at the younger ages, the large number of days of disablement shown as having prevailed in the Victorian Society at all the ages after 65 being especially noticeable.</p>

			<p>the table would make it appear that, so far as Victoria is concerned, no such regularity is discoverable in regard to the occurrence or duration of disabling illness, especially at the older ages ; and that neither the information derived from the Census nor the English experience affords a reliable basis for estimating the amount of sickness likely to be chargeable to the funds of Friendly Societies in this colony.</p>

				<p>In Victoria, in 1891, the proportion of males suffering from sickness and from sickness and accidents combined was lower than in 1881, but higher than in 1871, whilst the proportion of females suffering from sickness and from sickness and accidents combined was lower than at either of the two previous Census periods. The proportion, however, of males suffering from accidents was lower and that of females so suffering was higher than at either of those periods. The following are the proportions of disabled males and females to their respective numbers living at the three periods referred to, the sick being distinguished from those suffering from the effects of accidents :—

				<p>Persons laid up by sickness and accidents are less numerous in proportion to population in rural than in urban districts, which is no doubt partly attributable to the fact that the hospitals situated in the latter receive the disabled residents of the former as well as those whose ordinary abode is within their own limits. It will be observed in regard to accidents that—although the proportion is still greater in town than in country—the difference is not so marked as it is in the case of sickness.

				<p>In the case of both sickness and accidents, the largest proportion of disabled males were those engaged in the manufacture of arms and ammunition, but, the numbers being small, this was probably only a coincidence. Miners stood high under both heads, as also did military and naval officers and men, general labourers, and men whose occupations were not stated ; the inference in regard to the last named being that their disablement prevented them from following any occupation. Men of independent means stood high in point of sickness, but not nearly so high in point of accidents. Coach, cab, dray, and tram men stood sixth in regard to accidents, but as low as thirty-seventh in regard to sickness. In point of sickness clergymen stood considerably above medical men, but in point of accidents medical men were the higher. Lawyers</p>

			<p>stood below members of the other two learned professions in regard to both classes of affections. Servants and others engaged in attendance, who stood rather high in point of sickness, stood low in the matter of accidents. Amongst those who stood lowest in regard to both sickness and accidents were students and scholars, who numbered about 115,000, but they, as a matter of course, were for the most part children. Visitors and male relatives, numbering 83,000, the majority being children too young to go to school, also naturally stood low, especially in regard to accidents.</p>

				<p>Whilst no woman classed as a vagrant was set down as suffering from sickness, the three female vagrants set down as suffering from accidents bore so high a proportion to the whole number (350) so classed in the female population that they stood at the head of the list. Next to these in the accident list, and at the head of the sickness list, were the women whose occupation was not stated, numbering 6,000, the inference being—as in the case of the males of unstated callings—that their disablement prevented them from following any occupation. Women of independent means, numbering 13,000, stood high in regard to both sickness and accidents ; perhaps the constitutional disturbance consequent upon the troubles of maternity may have had something to do with this seeming anomaly. Domestic and other servants, numbering 39,000, occupied rather a high position in point of sickness, but one below the average in point of accidents. Milliners, dressmakers, &amp;c., numbering 26,000, occupied a middle position in regard to both kinds of affections. Wives, female relatives (including young children) and visitors employed, if at all, in domestic duties, and numbering 308,000, stood below the middle of the sickness list, and were near the bottom of the accident list. If wives had been classed separately they would no doubt have stood much higher, at any rate in the former list. Female students and scholars, generally children, were close to the bottom of both lists.</p>

				<p>Leprosy is included amongst the disabling infirmities, as, although a sufferer from that complaint may not be altogether disabled physically, the necessity of keeping him apart from the remainder of the population prevents him from rendering any service to the community at large.

				<p>It will be observed that exactly half the lepers are of Chinese and nearly a fourth of European race. It is believed that in all the colonies an endeavour is made to prevent the lepers from coming in contact with the remainder of the population, but it is stated that in Queensland 2 of the lepers mentioned, viz., 1 white and 1 South Sea Islander, had escaped from the Depot at Friday Island, and are still at large. It is stated that the disease with which the Maoris are afflicted is a native malady (<span class="emphasis">ngere-ngere</span>), but it is believed to be true leprosy.<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>There is a tradition amongst the Maoris that this complaint (also called<span class="emphasis">puhipuhi</span>and<span class="emphasis">tuwhenna</span>) was first introduced into New Zealand by the marooning a leper (probably a whaler) at or near Hauraki. Dr. A. Ginders, in an official report dated 4th July, 1890, expresses his firm conviction that the disease is true leprosy.</p>

				<p>With reference to the high position of Victoria relatively to several of the other colonies in regard not only to sickness but to most of the other infirmities respecting which information was obtained, it may be remarked that whilst Victoria has made inquiries on these subjects for the last four Censuses, some of the other colonies of the group made such inquiries for the first time in 1891. For obvious reasons, a new inquiry is not likely to be so fully or so correctly responded to as one to which both the Census collectors and the public have become accustomed, and a first attempt is likely to result in defective information and partial failure, as did the first attempt made in Victoria to obtain particulars of sickness and infirmity 30 years prior to the Census which forms the subject of this report, viz., in 1861. It will be readily understood, in regard to such a return as that under notice, that the more accurate and perfect the statistics, the worse position the country to which they relate appears to be in, and the more unfavorably will it seem to compare with other countries in which the returns are of a less complete character.</p>

				<p>According to the following figures, deaf-muteism appears to be rather diminishing in Victoria, the proportion of deaf and dumb persons to the population not being so high in 1891 as in 1881. Up to 1881, however, deaf-muteism was increasing very rapidly :—

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">565.</h3>
				<p>No deaf-mute was set down as being under 3 years of age. As deaf-muteism is generally congenital, it is probable there were some deaf-mutes at younger ages, but they were not returned as such, probably owing to the parents being disposed to hope that children in whom the sense of hearing was apparently absent might not ultimately turn out to be deaf and dumb.

					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">566.</h3>
				<p>As the deafness which eventually results in deaf-muteism generally dates from birth, and the numbers of the deaf and dumb become reduced by death as time advances, the numbers at the later ages are but small. It is to this cause, as also to the fact that deaf-mutes are probably in a more unfavorable position than others in regard to length of life, that the deficiency is observable at these ages. As many as 301 out of a total of 364 deaf-mutes were under 35 years of age ; still there are some old deaf-mutes, 1 man and 1 woman of this class being returned at 85 and upwards, 3 men and 1 woman between 75 and 80, 1 woman between 70 and 75, and 2 men and 1 woman between 65 and 70.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">567.</h3>
				<p>The following are the proportions of deaf-mutes to the numbers of the population at three periods of life :—</p>
			
			<table border="1" summary="VIC-1891-census_02-15_159-2"><caption>DEAF-MUTEISM AT VARIOUS AGES, 1891,</caption><tbody><tr><th>Under 15 years, 1 person in every 3,478 was deaf and dumb</th></tr><tr><th>15 to 35 1 person in every 2368 was deaf and dumb</th></tr><tr><th>35 and upwards 1 person in every ,4794 was deaf and dumb</th></tr></tbody></table>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">568.</h3>
				<p>It will be observed that the proportion of deaf-mutes to the population is much highest at the middle age-period. The low proportion at the first period is no doubt due to the fact of many infants and young children, who would eventually be deaf and dumb, not being included in the returns, whilst the low proportion at the last period can be due to no other cause than that deaf-muteism frequently has, directly or indirectly, the effect of shortening life, as already stated.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">569.</h3>
				<p>Although in proportion to the total population deaf and dumb males were more numerous than deaf and dumb females by 0.46 per 10,000, the latter were the more numerous at under 5, from 15 to 20, 25 to 30, and at 50 years and upwards. Most of the numbers at these ages, however, being very small, the excess of females may have been only accidental.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">570.</h3>
				<p>It should be mentioned that several of those tabulated as deaf and dumb were set down in the schedules simply as " dumb." Moreover, of those so tabulated, 3 males and 1 female were entered as partially deaf and dumb, 1 male as deaf,

				<p>At the Victorian Deaf and Dumb Institution the inmates are habitually instructed in such occupations as appear to be most suitable to the deaf and dumb, the chief being bootmaking, tailoring, and gardening for males, and household duties and plain and fancy needlework for females. Some acquire other trades outside the institution, and many in various parts of the colony are able to earn their livelihood and even to marry and support a family.

				<p>In proportion to the population, blindness has increased slightly since 1881. A larger increase took place between 1871 and 1881, and, according to the figures, a very much larger one between 1861 and 1871. The Census of 1861, however, being the first at which a return of blindness was asked for, it is almost certain that the number was, in many cases, overlooked by the sub-enumerators, and that, in consequence, the figures obtained did not show the full extent to which blindness prevailed at that time. The following are the proportions at the four periods referred to :—

				<p>Unlike the deaf and dumb, the proportion of blind persons in the population is much higher at the later than at the earlier ages. This will be at once seen by the following figures :—

				<p>Besides those set down as blind, 58 males and 45 females were returned as partially or nearly blind, and have not been included in the tables. There were, moreover, 901 males and 256 females who had lost an eye. These have been placed in the tables amongst the lame, mutilated, and deformed, and will be referred to later on. Two blind men were also deaf and dumb, one being also paralytic. These have been already referred to as included under the head of " Deaf-muteism."</p>

				<p>As a result of many of the blind having become so after they had reached a mature age, the occupations set down to them are of a more varied character than those of the deaf and dumb. The young are educated at the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind, and are taught not only to read and write (in Braille), but receive instruction in vocal and instrumental music and such industrial pursuits as the blind are capable of learning. The trades most commonly taught are basket-making, brush-making, and mat-making, the females learning also to perform household duties and to assist in the laundry, as well as to knit and sew. The following are the occupations returned at the Census as being those of the blind. Some of these callings were, no doubt, being practiced by them at the time the Census was taken, whilst others were their former occupations or those they had followed before they lost their sight :—

				<p>In addition to the return of the sufferers from total or partial blindness, an account was taken by some of the sub-enumerators of persons suffering from eye affections. No instruction was given to collect this information, but, from the fact of its having been sent in voluntarily from various parts of the colony, it is probable that such affections were prevalent.

				<p>In South Australia, as well as in Victoria, returns of eye affections were received from the Census collectors without having been specially applied for. The number of sufferers in the former colony was set down as 117, or 1 in 2,739 of the population, as against 184 sufferers in this colony, or 1 in 6,198 of the population.

				<p>Lunacy in early life is comparatively rare in Victoria, only 140 persons under 20 years of age being returned as suffering there from. From the age of 20 until that of 40 lunacy was found to have increased rapidly ; after that age there was a gradual increase continued to the age of 60, from which age onwards to the end of life the proportions remained stationary, as is made evident by the following figures :—

				<p>Returns of idiocy were obtained in 1871 and 1881 ; at both those periods, however, the proportion of idiots to the population was apparently much smaller than that at the Census under notice. It should be explained, however, that there is always some difficulty in getting correct returns of idiocy apart from lunacy, and there is reason to believe that the numbers were understated on both the former occasions. The figures, however, are given for what they may be worth :—

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">596.</h3>
				<p>At the younger ages the proportion of idiots returned was small ; it may, therefore, be supposed that idiocy is not always congenital. On the other hand it is to be considered that parents would probably shrink from returning their children as idiots whilst there was any hope of the weakness of intellect evinced in infancy and childhood not being permanent. Between 15 and 20 the proportion of idiots increased largely, but it fell again between 20 and 40, probably in consequence of the numbers afflicted with idiocy being reduced by death. From 40 to 60 the proportion differed but little from that between 20 and 40, but after 60 to the end of life it rose very rapidly, whence it is probable that persons who had become imbecile through age were frequently returned as idiots. The following are the proportions at five periods of life :—

				<p>Male idiots were more numerous than female idiots at most periods of life, the exceptions being the age groups 45 to 50, 50 to 55, and 80 to 85, in which females slightly preponderated, and the groups 30 to 35, 40 to 45, and 85 and upwards, in which the numbers of the sexes were equal.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">598.</h3>
				<p>The following are the occupations returned in the Census schedules as those of the idiots. It does not follow, however, that all these persons were pursuing those callings at the time of the Census. Indeed the nature of many of the callings is such that they could only be undertaken by persons whose intellect was unimpaired, the inference being that those following them had not been of weak intellect throughout the whole of their lives. In regard to those following them had not been of weak intellect through out the whole of their lives. In regard to those following some of the other callings it is probable that the morbid mental condition which led to their being set down as idiots only amounted to imbecility and was not of a very marked character<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>In the case of many of those returned as idiots it is doubtful whether they should properly have been placed in that category. Dr. Ireland, in his well-known work<span class="emphasis">On Idiocy and Imbecility</span>, subdivides idiots into five grades—the first, comprising those who can neither speak nor understand speech ; the second, those who can understand a few easy words ; the third, those who can speak and can be taught to work ; the fourth, those who can be taught to read and write ; and the fifth, those who can read books for themselves. Dr. Ireland seems to treat all idiocy as congenital, or as arising from circumstances taking place shortly after birth. The causes he defines to be, (1) hereditary predisposition, (2) constitutional conditions of one or both parents affecting the constitution of the infant, (3) injuries of the infant head prior to or at birth, or (4) injuries or diseases affecting the infant head during infancy.</p>

The number of persons returned as so suffering was 3,496, which, compared with a population of 1,527,224, furnishes a proportion of 2,289 maimed or deformed persons per 10,000 living, or 1 in 437.

				<p>The county of Villiers, although well adapted for agriculture owing to the richness of its soil, is to a great extent occupied by large pastoral holdings, and thus stands at the head of the list. The high position of Bourke is caused by the large number of animals stalled or stabled in Melbourne and its surrounding municipalities. Similarly, the presence of important towns in Dalhousie, Normanby, Talbot, Grant, and Grenville has the effect of raising the proportions in those counties.

				<p>The Census Act contained no instruction to take account of the extent of land in occupation or cultivation, but it was nevertheless considered desirable to obtain such information, if only to act as a cheek upon the persons appointed to collect the agricultural statistics which the municipal bodies are required to furnish annually to the Government. Provision was accordingly made in the householder's schedule for the insertion of the particulars referred to respecting every holding which exceeded 1 acre in extent.

				<p>The total area of Victoria is 56,245,760 acres ; the extent of Crown lands sold and finally parted with up to the end of 1890 (three months before the Census was taken) was 16,076,720 acres, and the extent granted without purchase was 15,160 acres.The whole area alienated in fee simple was thus 16,091,880 acres, of which 6,628,159 acres, or 41 per cent., were sold by auction, and nearly the whole of the remainder was originally acquired by selection under the system of deferred payments. The selected lands of which the purchase had not been completed up to the end of the year amounted to 10,430,182 acres. Of this extent it is estimated that 4,163,008 acres had been forfeited or abandoned, and had reverted to the Crown. The remainder, representing approximately the whole area in process of alienation under deferred payments, amounted to 6,267,174 acres.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">644.</h3>
				<p>If from the area of the colony, just stated to be 56,245,760 acres, be deducted the sum of the land granted, sold, and selected, amounting—less the extent forfeited—to 22,359,054 acres, it will follow that the residue, representing the Crown lands neither alienated nor in process of alienation, amounted at the end of 1890 to 33,886,706 acres.

				<p>The whole of this residue, however, is not available for settlement, for it embraces lands occupied by roads, the unsold portions of the sites of towns, and beds of rivers and lakes, the State forests, water, timber, education, and other reserves. Deducting these lands—amounting in the aggregate to 7,679,438 acres, also that portion of the colony known as the Mallee country, containing 11,572,000 acres, leased for pastoral purposes under special conditions, and 6,644,118 acres occupied under lease or licence for various terms of years—from the extent unalienated and unselected, already stated to have been 33,886,706 acres, it will be found that the available area is narrowed to 7,991,150 acres.

				<p>According to the Census returns, the number of occupiers of holdings in Victoria of more than one acre in extent was 61,512, and the area occupied was 33,434,750 acres, the average to each occupier being thus 544 acres.

				<p>Adding the sold and selected land (22,359,054 acres) to the Crown land held under pastoral leases and licences (21,716,236 acres), a total is obtained of 44,075,290 acres ; the whole extent set down as actually under occupation being no more than 33,434,750 acres, 500,000 acres being allowed for lots of one acre or less, it follows that, of<span class="paragraph-note">Illegible</span>and held under a tenure entitling it to be occupied, upwards of 10,000,000 acres (10,140,540), or 23 per cent., showed no sign of occupation when the Census was taken.

				<p>The number of cultivators returned at the Census was 39,249, and the extent of land set down as under tillage was 2,454,085 acres. The latter is less by about 200,000 acres than the extent returned about the same time by the collectors of agricultural statistics, the difference being probably owing to the fact that the collectors enter all the land lying fallow—amounting to 386,000 acres—as under cultivation, whereas in many instances the occupiers may not have so entered it in the Census schedules.

				<p>It must be remembered that holders of Crown, as well as of purchased or selected lands, are represented by the figures in the table. Many of the larger holdings no doubt consist to a great extent of the former. Some Crown lands, however, are also included in the smaller holdings, being held as grazing areas, from which the occupier may select his freehold up to 320 acres. The grazing areas are limited to a maximum of 1,000 acres, the balance above the extent selected being retained by the selector for the depasturing of stock.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">654.</h3>
				<p>From the fact that the largest extent the law allows to be selected for a freehold is 320 acres, it would appear that it is considered desirable to limit estates to this size if possible. The figures in the table show that 45,288, or 74 per cent., of the occupiers, and 26,411, or 67 per cent., of the cultivators were holding lots of or under this area.</p>

				<p>More than nine-tenths of the cultivation, or all except a little over 200,000 acres, is upon blocks between 100 and 5,000 acres in extent, the largest quantity—more than a fifth—being upon blocks ranging from 200 to 320 acres, and the next largest—nearly a fifth—being upon blocks ranging between 1,000 and 5,000 acres in extent. The largest extent of cultivation to each occupier, viz., 125 acres, and the largest extent to each cultivator, viz., 160 acres, are upon blocks ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 acres.

				<p>At the Census of 1881 no account was taken of the number of holders of land or of the extent occupied and cultivated, and thus the difference between the two periods named in the table is twenty years. It will be noticed that whilst there was an increase during that interval of 5,738 in the number of holdings of from 1 acre to 5 acres, and of 19,336 in the number of holdings of upwards of 100 acres, also an increase of 1,022 acres and 1,712,803 acres in the land under cultivation on those groups of holdings respectively, there was a falling-off of 2,120 holdings containing from 6 acres to 100 acres, and of 64,248 acres in the cultivation upon such holdings.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">661.</h3>
				<p>It will further be remarked that of the land returned as in occupation, there was a falling-off of nearly 80,000 acres in lots of from 31 to 100 acres, and of 7,000,000 acres in lots of 501 acres and upwards, the net falling-off, after allowing for increases which took place under other heads, being about 3½ million acres. It is not likely, however, that less land was in profitable occupation at the latter period than at the former, but it is probable that some tracts of country which, from remoteness or other circumstances, had been found unsuitable for settlement were abandoned by the Crown lessee rather than that he should continue to pay rent for territory which, so far as his purpose was concerned, had turned out to be worthless.</p>

				<p>The laws and regulations under which land passes from the Crown into the hands of private individuals differ in the various Australasian Colonies. In almost all, however, provision in made to allow any person of 18 years of age or over—not being a married woman—to select a certain limited area of Crown land, and to pay the purchase money by instalments, the compliance with certain conditions of residence and improvement being also required before the selector becomes entitled to a Crown grant. Prior to the adoption of this system, the Crown lands were disposed of either at a fixed price or by auction, and in the early days of some of the colonies large blocks were granted to individuals without payment. The following are the areas of the different colonies and the extent of territory alienated and remaining unalienated in each colony at the end of 1890 :—

				<p>It has been the custom in most of the Australasian Colonies to return the area of land laid down with permanent artificial grasses, also that lying fallow, as forming part of the land in cultivation, and this has led many to adopt an exaggerated view of the extent of land on which crops are actually being raised.

				<p>The difference between the net value of the imports of certain vegetable products, as shown in this table, and that of the exports of certain other of such products, as shown in the previous one, is only £112,135 in favour of the exports, but if timber should not be taken into account, the difference, also in favour of exports, would be £968,622.</p>

				<p>It will be noticed that neither wine, spirits, beer, cider, nor vinegar is included amongst the articles named in the table.

The sum of these is £681,745, which, added to the total in the table, gives an amount of £2,262,691 as the value of the net imports of certain products derived either directly or indirectly from the soil. With knowledge and enterprise most of these articles might have been raised or manufactured in Victoria to the manifest advantage of the colony.

			<h1 class="section-title">OCCUPATIONS OF THE PEOPLE.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">676.</h3>
				<p>The inquiry respecting the occupations of the people is one of the most important of those made at the Census, yet it is the most difficult to deal with, and the one which often affords the least satisfactory results after being completed.
						<span class="annotation"> [Occupations, Table LXI. et seq.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">677.</h3>
				<p>The subject received special consideration at the hands of the Statistical Conference to which allusion has more than once been made, and it was resolved to make important changes in the methods adopted on previous occasions.
						<span class="annotation"> [Changes in mode of classifying occupations.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">678.</h3>
				<p>The form in accordance with which the Victorian tables were constructed in 1871 and 1881 was based upon a system of classification originally devised by the late Dr. Farr, C.B., F.R.S., of the General Register Office ; London, for use in connexion with the Census of England and Wales, modifications having been made in it by my-self at the former period in order to render it suitable to the circumstances of the Australasian colonies. Following the example set by Victoria in 1871, the form thus modified was adopted in 1881 in all the colonies of the group except New South Wales. The method is accurate and scientific, and, when introduced by Farr, was much in advance of any classification which had been previously attempted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere ; with some slight variations it has been used in compiling the Census of England and Wales ever since it was inaugurated in 1851.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">679.</h3>
				<p>It had, however, certain defects which were recognised by Farr, but were considered by him too formidable to cope with.<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>These defects could only be met by the insertion of special provisions in the Householder's Schedule, in the preparation of which it is probable that Farr had no voice.</p>
					</div>The Census Conference referred to, however, resolved to attempt to overcome them, and has, I believe, been fairly successful in accomplishing that object.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">680.</h3>
				<p>So far as the commercial and manufacturing members of the community were concerned, Farr's system was based on a consideration of the materials dealt in</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_191"></div>
			<p>or worked upon, but it was deemed by him impossible to separate the dealers from the workers. Thus those who sold boots and shoes, clothes, or millinery, but did not manufacture any such articles, were classed with shoemakers, tailors, dressmakers, and others who did do so under the head of " dealers and workers in dress ;" those who dealt in wool, leather, or hides were classed with fellmongers and tanners under the head of " dealers and workers in animal matters ;" those who kept butchers' shops but did not slaughter any animals were classed with slaughtermen under the head of " dealers and workers in animal food ;" wine, beer, and spirit merchants were classed with brewers and distillers under the head of " dealers and workers in drinks and stimulants ;" and so on in the case of a number of other trades.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">681.</h3>
				<p>The Conference determined to meet this difficulty by placing a special column in the Householder's Schedule in which persons might enter the letter " D" or " M", as the case might be, to signify whether they were dealers or manufacturers. It was foreseen that in many cases both letters would be inserted to indicate that the individual respecting whom the entry was made occupied both positions, which was no doubt the case as, goods being made to sell, he who makes them must be, in a certain sense, a dealer as well as a manufacturer. On this point it was decided that, in tabulating the returns, when the two letters occurred the letter indicating the manufacturer should, for obvious reasons, have the preference, whilst that indicating the dealer should, in such case, be ignored.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">682.</h3>
				<p>It was, moreover, considered by Farr that, except in the case of domestic servants, farm labourers, and a few other callings, it would be impossible to separate the employed from the employers, as almost every grocer's assistant would not improperly be returned as a grocer, every tailor's or bootmaker's journeyman would be returned as a tailor or a bootmaker, as the case may be, and there would similarly be an absence of distinction between masters and men in the case of other trades ; it was therefore determined by the Conference to place a special column in the schedule wherein the person making the entries should write the letter " E" for employer, " O" if working on own account without employing others, " W" if in receipt of wages or salary, and " U" if unemployed or out of work during the week preceding the day on which the Census was taken.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">683.</h3>
				<p>These were the two main points in which the system adopted in connexion with the occupations differed from Farr's modified system used at former Censuses, and it is satisfactory to be able to state that, so far as Victoria is concerned, and I believe also in the case of most of the other Australasian colonies, the changes referred to were effected with marked success. There is always a danger of some misapprehension occurring when any novelty is introduced in the taking of a Census, but it appears that, on the present occasion, what was required was in most instances readily understood both by the sub-enumerators and the public, and that, with a few exceptions, the new entries were correctly made. If the same system should be carried out at the next Census, it may reasonably be expected that even greater accuracy will be achieved.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">684.</h3>
				<p>In tabulating the Census returns it has hitherto been the custom to include in Class I., under the head of Government officers, all persons known to be employed by the State except those connected with the administration of the law</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_192"></div>
			<p>and those engaged in railway or telegraph service. Owing to these exceptions, also in consequence of professional men, clerks, draughtsmen, &amp;c., in Government employment often merely entering their profession or status without stating they were connected with the Government, the Census list was always imperfect ; and it was consequently decided by the Conference that no attempt should be made to give a complete statement of public officers from the Census returns ; but that all who were returned as performing duties of a special, technical, or professional nature should be classed according to their employment without reference to their official position, and that those only should be classed as Government officers who were attached to departments in which the work was mainly administrative or clerical, or who returned themselves simply as " civil servants," " Government or public officers," &amp;c., without any reference to the department in which they served or their position therein. The same system was also to a certain extent carried out in regard to officers of municipal government—engineers, surveyors, and draughtsmen in that service being classed according to their professions, not as municipal officers.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">685.</h3>
				<p>But although a complete account of the number of public officers was not, and could not be, compiled from the Census schedules, such an account, together with particulars of the salaries paid, has been obtained for the different Departments of the State in regard to Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, and will be given later on.<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>See paragraph 758<span class="emphasis">et seq., post.</span></p>
					</div></p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">686.</h3>
				<p>Another important change in the Census tabulation was made in reference to the wives and grown-up daughters of farmers, all of whom at previous Censuses were tabulated as engaged in agricultural pursuits unless some other occupation was entered. Although no doubt the female relatives of farmers, if living on the farm, attend, as a rule, to the lighter duties of the poultry-yard and dairy, it was felt by the Conference that the statement that so many females were engaged in agricultural pursuits would create an impression elsewhere that women were in the habit of working in the fields as they are in some of the older countries of the world, but certainly are not in Australia. It was therefore decided not to class any women as engaged in agricultural pursuits except those respecting whom words were entered expressing that they were so occupied, the others to be classed in the same way as other women respecting whom no employment was entered—under the head of " Domestic Duties."</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">687.</h3>
				<p>In 1871 and 1881, so far as Victoria was concerned, the occupations of males and females under and over 20 years of age were alone distinguished in the returns, but on this occasion, in pursuance of a suggestion made by the Registrar-General of England, the persons following the different callings have been grouped, as in England and Wales, in seven periods of age, viz. :—Under 5 years, 5 to 15 years, 15 to 20 years, 20 to 25 years, 25 to 45 years, 45 to 65 years, and 65 years and upwards.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">688.</h3>
				<p>In the following diagram the relative importance, numerically, of the various occupations followed by the people of Victoria is demonstrated by means of spaces corresponding in size with the number of persons engaged in the respective trades or callings represented by the groups to which the spaces refer :—

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">689.</h3>
				<p>As on former occasions, the inhabitants of the colony have been grouped according to their occupations, in classes, orders, and sub-orders ; but, as might be expected, the separation of the traders from the workers, which has been already referred to, has caused the tables to be considerably more lengthy than heretofore. The classes now number 7 instead of 6, the orders 25 instead of 15, and the sub-orders 107 instead of 62, whilst the specific occupations tabulated number 561 instead of 380. The latter are still further subdivided, so that, in all, the names of nearly 1,200 distinct callings are shown, together with the number of males and females following each calling.
						<span class="annotation"> [Classes, orders, and sub-orders.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">690.</h3>
				<p>All of the classes, orders, and sub-orders contain males, and all of the classes and orders contain females. Twelve of the sub-orders, however, contain no female, viz., those embracing persons ministering to defence, and to engineering, surveying, and architecture ; persons dealing in type, designs, medals and dies, in watches, clocks, and scientific instruments, in arms and explosives, in harness, saddlery, and leatherware, and in animal waste products ; speculators in chance events ; workers in musical instruments, in equipment for sports and games, and in ships and boats ; and persons engaged in forestry and acquiring the products of natural vegetation.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">691.</h3>
				<p>As recommended by the Conference, the occupations of the people have been tabulated omitting the Chinese and Aborigines. Unless otherwise stated, therefore, the following paragraphs relate to the population exclusive of members of those two races. The occupations of the Chinese and Aborigines, however, have been tabulated separately, and will be referred to later on.

				<p>Exclusive of the Chinese and Aborigines, the population amounted to 1,130,463, viz., 589,317 males and 541,146 females ; there were, moreover, 6,686 persons, viz., 5,265 males and 1,421 females, whose occupations were not returned. If these also be excluded, the total will be reduced to 1,123,777, viz., 584,052 males and 539,725 females.

				<p>Whilst the first six of these classes represent the breadwinning portion of the population, the seventh class represents the dependents. The following is a short description of the contents of each class :—</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">Class I.—Professional—</h3>
				<p>Embraces persons, not otherwise classed, engaged in the government and defence of the country, in maintaining law and order, or in satisfying the moral, intellectual, and social wants of its inhabitants.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">Class II.—Domestic—</h3>
				<p>Embraces persons engaged in the supply of board and lodging, or in rendering personal services for which payment is usually made.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">Class III.—Commercial.—</h3>
				<p>Embraces persons engaged in pursuits connected with the purchase, sale, exchange, hire, custody, or security of money, land, and goods ; or with the conveyance, distribution, and delivery of passengers, goods, or communications.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">Class IV.—Industrial.—</h3>
				<p>Embraces persons, not otherwise classed, engaged in works or specialities connected with the construction, modification, or alteration of materials, so as to render them more suitable for the use of man.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">Class V.—Primary Producers.—</h3>
				<p>Embraces persons mainly engaged in the cultivation or acquisition of food products, or in obtaining other raw materials from natural sources.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">Class VI.—Indefinite.—</h3>
				<p>Embraces persons living upon incomes awarded for services rendered at some previous period, or upon fixed incomes derived from moneys invested.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">Class VII.—Dependents.—</h3>
				<p>Embraces wives, relatives, and others employed, if employed at all, in household or other pursuits for which payment is not usually made ; also children and others being educated, and persons supported by public or private charity or detained in penal institutions.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">695.</h3>
				<p>The persons grouped in the third or Commercial class may be termed " Distributers," those in the fourth or Industrial class " Modifiers," and those in the fifth class " Producers." The sum of the numbers in the fourth and fifth classes is 291,123, and there being 98,472 in the third class, it follows that there were 34 distributers or traders to every 100 modifiers and producers.

					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">696.</h3>
				<p>It is shown by the table that in every 1,000 of the population 26 belonged to the Professional Class, 51 to the Domestic Class, 88 to the Commercial Class, 149 to the Industrial Class, 110 to the Primary Producing Class, 16 to the Indefinite Class, and 560 to the Class of Dependents.

				<p>The Professional, Domestic, and Commercial Classes together contained 185,083 persons. These do not create wealth, but either distribute it or render services for which realized wealth is paid. The Industrial and Primary Producing Classes—which are those which create wealth—together contained 291,123 persons, or 106,040 more than the first three, the first three, the proportion being 64 of the former to every 100 of the latter.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">698.</h3>
				<p>In the Professional, Commercial, Industrial, and Primary Producing Classes males greatly exceeded females, but in the Domestic, Indefinite, and Dependent Classes females were much the more numerous.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">699.</h3>
				<p>In the Indefinite Class there were only 4,485 males and as many as 13,286 females. This class relates almost entirely to persons of independent means, amongst whom, in consequence of there being so many widows living on incomes (probably for the most part of small amount), females greatly preponderated.

					<p>The first and most important division of the population in respect to their occupations is into two sections, viz., breadwinners or food providers and non-breadwinners or dependents.

					<p>It will be observed that the breadwinners numbered 493,977, upon whom devolved the maintenance of 629,800 dependents. In other words, 44 per cent. of the population was charged with the support of the remaining 56 per cent.

As regards the females, at no age did the proportion reach as high as 50 per cent. ; the highest proportion of breadwinners of this sex (47½ per cent.) occurring in the case of those between 15 and 20, and the next (43 per cent.) in that of those between 20 and 25. After 25, when many of the women have married, and have consequently become dependents, the proportion falls off to little more than a fifth of the whole number living, but from 45 to 65, when there are many widows, it again rises, and increases still further in the period 65 and upwards, when many more women have lost their protectors.</p>

					<p>Soon after the date of the Census of 1851 the gold discoveries took place, and it was felt that a mode of classifying the occupations which placed those of more than half the inhabitants of the colony under the head of "Residue" was insufficient to meet the requirements of the increased population. Therefore, a new system, of which the following is a condensation, was devised, and was used in 1857 and 1861. It was again superseded by a better system in 1871, but the returns obtained at the Census taken in that year and at the two subsequent Censuses have been fitted to it for purposes of comparison :—

					<p>In proportion to the total population, a falling off will be observed in those engaged in agricultural, pastoral, and mining pursuits, and in the dependent classes, embracing both those engaged in household duties or being educated, and those dependent on charity or in prison.

					<p>Between 1881 and 1891 the persons engaged in agricultural pursuits increased in actual numbers ; but in proportion to population they fell off by nearly 16 per 1,000. The land under crop<div class="footnote">* 
							<p>Not including land under permanent artificial grass and land in fallow.</p>
						</div>was 1,548,809 acres in the former and 2,031,955 acres in the latter year. The persons engaged in agriculture being 81,908 and 91,043, it follows that a larger result was produced in 1891 than in 1881, the proportion under crop per head being 22 acres, as against only 19 acres. As compared with the total population the average under crop was about the same in both years, viz., 1.8 acre per head.

					<p>The live stock in the colony, reduced to its equivalent in sheep, numbered 25,978,115 in 1881, and 34,886,343 in 1891. The persons engaged in pastoral pursuits being 11,822 and 14,702, it follows that there was 1 such person to every 2,197 sheep or their equivalent at the first period, and 1 to every 2,373 at the second period. To each individual of the population the proportions were 30 sheep in 1881, and 31 sheep in 1891.

The gold miners proper numbered 52,425 in 1871, 35,189 in 1881, but only 21,206 in 1891. The gold raised at the three periods respectively was 1,355,477 oz., 858,850 oz., and 576,400 oz., the average per gold miner being thus 25oz., 17dwt. At the first period, 24oz. 8dwt. At the middle period, and 27oz. 4dwt. At the last period. The value of gold raised per man was greatest (£108 16s.) in 1891 ; next greatest (£103 8s.) in 1871 ; and least (£97 12s.) in 1881.

					<p>It appears that as time has advanced the population has become stronger in the sense that the proportion of the supporting classes has become larger, and consequently that of the dependent classes has become smaller. In 1871 and 1881 the proportions of male breadwinners were about equal ; whilst at the former period only about a sixth, but at the latter more than a fifth, of the female population were engaged in breadwinning occupations. In 1891, whilst the proportion of female breadwinners was the same as that in 1881, the proportion of male breadwinners was much higher than at either of the former periods.</p>

					<p>The number of persons in the receipt of incomes in their broadest sense—including not only those derived from investments, payments for professional services, or profits of trade or agriculture, but the daily wages received by labourers and others—may be considered to be indentical with that of the breadwinners, viz., 493,977. After carefully analyzing the occupation returns item by item, and assigning to the persons of each calling the incomes they would probably possess, I have arrived at a total of 53 millions sterling as the estimated aggregate income of all the persons in the colony.

					<p>If a mean be taken of the amounts arrived at by the two methods of calculating incomes, a result is obtained of £50,545,300, which sum may be held to represent a fair estimate for the aggregate of the incomes of the people of Victoria ; this, divided by the total population, gives an average of £44 6s. 5d. per head.
							<span class="annotation"> [Average income per head.] </span>

					<h3 class="paragraph-title">737.</h3>
					<p>Both estimates express the gross incomes of the people, and consequently some incomes are dependent on, and form a part of, others, and thus money is often included more than once. The total amount capitalized at 5 per cent. would give a result exceeding 1,000 millions sterling, which is more than twice, perhaps three times, too high an estimate for the private wealth of the community. The annual value of primary productions—including those derived from enterprises carried on in other colonies by Victorian residents—probably more nearly indicates the sum of the single incomes of the people. This amounts to about £32,000,000 sterling, which, divided amongst the breadwinning portion of the population, gives an average of £63 14s. 6d. per head, or, if divided amongst the whole population, gives an average of £28 per head.

					<h3 class="paragraph-title">738.</h3>
					<p>It should be pointed out that the estimates made are intended to express the incomes as they existed in 1891, and probably also their amount at times when the colony is in a normal state of prosperity ; but during the last two years the monetary stringency caused by the collapse of a number of financial institutions, combined with the temporary stoppage of banks and other causes, has had the effect of seriously reducing incomes. In view, however, of the boundless resources of Victoria, it is confidently expected that when the depression now prevailing throughout Australasia, in common with most other countries, passes away, the incomes of the people of this colony will not be less in proportion to the population than they are now shown to have been before the period of depression commenced.

					<p>According to the figures, the largest number of unemployed males were found amongst general labourers, followers of the building trades, miners, farm servants, and those connected with commerce (chiefly clerks and shopmen), in the order named. At the same time painters, tailors, brass and iron workers, seamen, carters and carriers, navies, servants, and implement makers were out of work in considerable numbers. Amongst females the largest numbers of unemployed were dressmakers and tailoresses, domestic servants, and teachers.</p>
				
				
					<h3 class="paragraph-title">753.</h3>
					<p>The unemployed males were in the proportion of 52½ and the unemployed females in that of 29, per 1,000 breadwinners of their respective sexes.

					<p>In proportion to those ready to pursue breadwinning occupations, the number of unemployed males was greater than that of unemployed females at all the ages named in the table, excepting 15 to 20. The males, as they advance in age, appear to find increasing difficulty in obtaining constant employment, the proportion out of work at each period of age being larger than that at the preceding period, until at the age of 65 and upwards all but about 7 per cent. were unemployed. Exactly the reverse was the case in regard to females at all ages after 15, in consideration of the lighter duties of whom, in the matter of nursing and domestic service, age apparently does not present so great a bar to their finding employment as it does in the case of men in view of the severer labours performed by them.</p>

					<p>By the above statement it would appear that a large proportion of prisoners, according to their callings, must at one time have occupied good, and in some instances superior positions. As many as 634 of the men, or 43 per cent., were set down as labourers, navies, or excavators, whilst most of the remainder had acquired trades or professions, or held situations which it might be supposed would have had the effect of placing them above want or the temptation to commit crimes. Not one of either sex was set down as belonging originally to the criminal classes, but 8 of the women were set down as prostitutes.</p>

					<p>The letter (<span class="emphasis">h</span>) indicates that the proportion against which it is placed is higher and the letter (<span class="emphasis">l</span>) that such proportion is lower than the corresponding proportion in any of the other colonies ; thus in Victoria the proportions of dealers and workers in textile fabrics and dress (Orders 6 and 15), dealers in food and drinks (Order 7), dealers in animal and vegetable substances (Order 8), dealers and workers in minerals and metals (Orders 9 and 18), dealers in fuel and light (Order 10), persons engaged in mercantile pursuits (Order 11), workers in buildings, railways, roads, &amp;c.

					<p>In New Zealand, it will be observed, the proportion of breadwinners to the population was smaller, and consequently the proportion of dependents was larger than in any of the other colonies. The following statement shows the relative proportions of the two classes in each colony :—</p>
				
				<ul>

						<p>In New Zealand 100 breadwinners sustained 151 dependents</p>

					<p>It is by means of the exertions of the breadwinners that the taxation is raised and the public revenue is provided.

					<p>Victoria occupies the lowest position but one in reference to the average amount of revenue contributed by each breadwinner, as she did in reference to the average amount of taxation so contributed. New South Wales, which occupied the lowest place in the case of taxation, occupies the highest place in that of revenue. Her high position in the following list, as well as her low position on the former one, is owing to the large amount she is able to raise by the sale and occupation of Crown lands,<div class="footnote">*

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">793.</h3>
				<p>It is possible that some persons possessed of the desire to become acquainted with the more salient facts brought to light by the Census of 1891 might wish to avoid the labour of making their way through the mazes and intricacies of the foregoing lengthy report. For the benefit of these I think it well to give a summary of the principal results derived from the returns, together with references to the paragraphs in which the respective subjects are dealt with at length.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">795.</h3>
				<p>The increase of population between the Censuses of 1881 and 1891 was 278,059, viz., 146,331 males and 131,728 females. The rate of increase of the whole population was 32.2 per cent., that of the male population 32.4 per cent., and that of the female population 32.1 per cent. (94 to 97).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">796.</h3>
				<p>In 1891 the town population numbered 620,240, or 55 per cent. of the whole ; the country population numbered 517,635, or 45 per cent. of the whole (79).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">797.</h3>
				<p>In the intercensal period, 1881-91, the urban population increased by 185,773, or at the rate of 43 per cent., whilst the rural population increased by only 97,574, or at the rate of 23 per cent. (99).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">798.</h3>
				<p>Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, with its suburbs (Greater Melbourne) contained 490,896 persons in 1891, or 43 per cent. of the total population of the colony. The district under the Metropolitan Board of Works contained 476,849 persons, or 14,047 less than Greater Melbourne (81 to 83).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">799.</h3>
				<p>The increase of population in Greater Melbourne during the intercensal period was 207,949, or at the rate of 73½ per cent. (115 and 123).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">800.</h3>
				<p>The Census showed Melbourne to be the most populous city in the Southern Hemisphere. It contained 24,629 more inhabitants than Buenos Aires, 81,896 more than Rio de Janeiro, and 103,462 more than Sydney (86).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">801.</h3>
				<p>With their respective suburbs, Ballarat was found to contain 46,158 inhabitants in 1891 ; at the same time Bendigo contained 38,348 ; Geelong, 24,283 ; Castlemaine, 6,804 ; Warrnambool, 6,582 ; and Stawell, 5,183. No other town outside the metropolitan district contained as many as 5,000 persons (81).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">802.</h3>
				<p>The population of the Australian continent was 3,086,614 in 1891, and the population of that continent combined with Tasmania and New Zealand was 3,901,932. Between 1881 and 1891 the increase of the former was at the rate of 42.49 per cent., and that of the latter at the rate of 38.57 per cent. (64 and 117).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">803.</h3>
				<p>In Victoria the number of persons to the square mile was 12.98, the density of population being much greater than in any other Australasian colony. The number to the square mile was 6.40 in New Zealand, 5.56 in Tasmania, 3.66 in New South Wales, and less than 1 in the other three colonies (172).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">804.</h3>
				<p>Should the population between 1891 and 1901 increase at the same rate as it did between 1881 and 1891 the population of Victoria at the next decennial census would number 1,508,000, whilst at the same period the population of the Australian continent would number 4,398,000, and that of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand would number 5,407,000 (98 and 122).</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">806.</h3>
				<p>On the continent of Australia females were in the proportion of 85.96 to every 100 males, and on that continent combined with Tasmania and New Zealand in the proportion of 86.42 to every 100 males (141).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">807.</h3>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">809.</h3>
				<p>In Victoria only 565 Aborigines were enumerated, although it is believed the actual number was 731. The number partly enumerated and partly estimated in the whole of Australasia (including 41,993 Maoris) was 101,596 (72 and 74).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">810.</h3>
				<p>The number of habitations returned in 1891 was 241,560. Of these 224,021 were occupied, 15,846 were vacant, and 1,693 were unfinished (176 and 178).

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">811.</h3>
				<p>The increase of habitations between 1881 and 1891 was 61,744, or 34 per cent. (177).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">812.</h3>
				<p>In Greater Melbourne the occupied houses in 1891 numbered 93,617, and the empty houses numbered 8,043 (181 and 182).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">813.</h3>
				<p>The total number of rooms was 1,232,524, or about 5 to a house. Taking the rooms as a basis of valuation for the houses irrespective of the land on which they stood, an average of £70 a room would give a total of 86¼ millions sterling (191).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">814.</h3>
				<p>In Victoria as a whole there were on the average 2½ inhabited houses to the square mile (193 and 195).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">815.</h3>
				<p>Throughout the colony there were about 5 persons to an inhabited house, and there was close on 1 person to a room (201 and 205).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">816.</h3>
				<p>On the continent of Australia there was an inhabited dwelling to every 5 square miles, and an average of 5¼ persons to each such dwelling ; on that continent, combined with Tasmania and New Zealand, there was an inhabited dwelling to about 4 square miles, and an average of 5[FORMULA] persons to each such dwelling (210).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">817.</h3>
				<p>Of the total population 1,105,279, or 97 per cent., were British subjects ; and 35,126, or 3 per cent., were foreign subjects (216, 219, and 232).
						<span class="annotation"> [Birthplaces.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">818.</h3>
				<p>Sixty-three per cent. of the inhabitants of Victoria were natives of the colony, and 7 per cent. were natives of other colonies of the group ; thus 70 per cent. of the whole were natives of Australasia (221).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">819.</h3>
				<p>In the Australasian Colonies as a whole the natives thereof numbered 2,643,083, or about 68 per cent. of the total population (240).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">820.</h3>
				<p>Victoria appears to present greater attractions to natives of other colonies of the group than those colonies present to Victorians, inasmuch as whilst 77,045 natives of extra-Victorian colonies were living in Victoria only 69,018 natives of Victoria were living in such colonies (245).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">821.</h3>
				<p>After natives of the Australasian Colonies, persons born in the United Kingdom formed the most numerous section of the population. These numbered 298,881, and amounted to rather over a fourth of the whole (227).</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_246"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">822.</h3>

				<p>Of foreigners, natives of Germany or German possessions were the most numerous, and numbered 10,775 ; then natives of China, who numbered 8,467 ; then natives of Sweden and Norway, who numbered 3,214 ; and then natives of the United States, who numbered 2,905 (232 to 234).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">824.</h3>
				<p>During the intercensal period, 1881-1891, natives of all important foreign countries increased in numbers, except those of France, who fell off by 27, and those of China, who fell off by 3,332. The greatest increase was in the case of Germans, the next in that of Swedes and Norwegians, and the next in that of Russians (234).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">825.</h3>
				<p>In the district subject to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works natives of British dominions numbered 462,240,<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>In the body of the Report (paragraph 236) this number is set down in error as 462,260.</p>

				<p>On the Australian continent British subjects were in the proportion of 95 per cent. and foreigners of 5 per cent. to the population. In the whole of Australasia, British subjects were in the proportion of 96 per cent. and foreigners of 4 per cent. to the population (239).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">828.</h3>
				<p>China is the only country of which the natives resident in Australasia decreased in numbers between the last two Censuses, the falling-off being 2,932 (241 and 242).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">829.</h3>
				<p>Of 1,117,528 persons who stated their religious belief in 1891, 836,857, or 75 per cent., were Protestants, and 248,591, or 22 per cent., were Roman Catholics (254 to 258).

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">830.</h3>
				<p>Protestants gained and Roman Catholics lost ground between 1881 and 1891, inasmuch as at the former period only 73 per cent. of the population were Protestants and as many as 24 per cent. were Roman Catholics (257).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">831.</h3>
				<p>Of the Protestants 417,182, or about half, were members of the Church of England ; 167,027, or a fifth, were Presbyterians ; and 158,040, or rather less than a fifth, were Methodists ; Independents numbered 22,110 ; and Baptists 27,883 (259).</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">833.</h3>
				<p>Of other Protestant bodies the most important are Lutherans, who numbered 15,529 ; members of the Salvation Army, who numbered 13,521 ; and "Disciples of Christ," who numbered 8,267 (253 and 268).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">834.</h3>
				<p>Jews numbered 6,459, and increased by about 50 per cent. between 1881 and 1891. This large increase is believed to have consisted chiefly of refugees from Russia (270).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">835.</h3>
				<p>In consequence of the smaller number of Chinese in Victoria, Buddhists, Confucians, &amp;c., fell off from 11,159 in 1881 to 6,746 in 1891 (253 and 271).</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">845.</h3>
				<p>At the age of 65 or upwards returns of 39,378 persons were obtained. To provide five shillings per week for each of these, as has been proposed by certain advocates of old age pensions, it would be necessary to raise the sum of £ 512,000 annually (310).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">846.</h3>
				<p>Males numbering 2,025, or 1 in every 296, and females numbering 1,501, or 1 in every 361, had passed their eightieth birthday. Of these, 173 males and 129 females had passed their ninetieth, and 5 males and 5 females had passed their hundredth.

				<p>From 15 to 45 years of age is the reproductive age of women. The number between those ages in 1891 was 262,622, or 4,846 per 10,000 females at all ages. This is a higher proportion than that obtaining in any of the other Australasian Colonies (315 and 330).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">848.</h3>
				<p>In the case of men, from 20 to 40 is termed the "soldiers' age." There were 206,260 at that age in 1891, or 1,810 per 10,000 of both sexes living in Victoria. The Australasian Colonies, as a whole, were found to contain enough males at the soldiers' age to admit of their raising a joint army of close upon 690,000 men (317 and 334).</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">849.</h3>
				<p>In every 10,000 persons living, Victoria contained 6,190 at the middle or most effective period of life (15 to 65 years). This was 66 more than the proportion in Queensland, 278 more than that in New South Wales, 416 more than that in New Zealand, 460 more than that in South Australia, 558 more than that in Tasmania, but 113 less than that in Western Australia (319 and 336).</p>

			<h1 class="section-title">CONCLUSION.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1001.</h3>
				<p>In concluding this Report, I feel it my duty to impress upon the Government the desirability of having a Census taken oftener than once in ten years. It will be remembered that the apparent population of Victoria, or that arrived at by adding the excess of registered births over registered deaths, and the excess of recorded arrivals over recorded departures to the population enumerated at the previous Census, exceeded the true population by 67,437 in 1881, and by 66,987 in 1891 ; and, if the error was so great in the mere numbers of the people, it is evident that all calculations respecting the birthplaces, religions, ages, occupations, conjugal condition, education, or state of health of the members of the community, or indeed any computations based upon the supposed population, would be vitiated also. In two of the colonies of the group a Census is now taken every five years ; in neither of them, it may be supposed, is the Treasurer anxious to spend the public money unnecessarily, and if the proceeding were not found to be advantageous it would be discontinued.
						<span class="annotation"> [Conclusion.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1002.</h3>
				<p>Apart from the inaccuracies occurring in intercensal computations, resulting from the length of time which, in this colony, is allowed to intervene between one Census and another, it must be remembered that the experience gained by those engaged in the work is to a great extent lost in so long a period as ten years. Every one, after superintending the operations of a Census, feels how much more effectively he could do so if he had to begin again. But after the expiration of ten years, lapse of time and attention to the details of quite different duties have probably caused him to forget much of what he had learned, and, even if this should not be the case, the staff he had organized and trained with care to a full knowledge of the work is scattered, and he has to begin again the harassing task with a fresh set of men.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1003.</h3>
				<p>I believe that the majority of the statesmen of Australasia are in favour of the population being enumerated more frequently than it is at present ; and I submit that the cost, which after all is not ruinous, ought not to stand in the way of a Census being taken at least quinquennially. I have no hesitation in saying that the extra money expended would not be wasted, but would be found in the end to operate beneficially to the community.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1004.</h3>
				<p>In drawing up this Report, my aim has been to give prominence to such facts as have been brought to light by means of the inquiries made at the Census, and especially to invite attention to points of interest contained in, or readily deducible from, the tables which might otherwise escape observation. I have, however, made but few generalizations, contenting myself with supplying to my readers materials wherefrom to draw conclusions and set up theories should they see fit to do so, preferring this course rather than to attempt a task which would be better performed by those having more leisure than I possess, and possibly more ability than falls to my share.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1005.</h3>
				<p>I have endeavoured to make this work complete in itself, but I would still draw attention to the fact that the heavier tables of the Census have been embodied in nine distinct Parliamentary Papers, which should be consulted by those who require more detailed information than is here given.</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_265"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1006.</h3>
				<p>I notice, without disapproval, that my Report upon the Census of 1881 has been made extensive use of in the Statistical Department of more than one of Her Majesty's Possessions outside Victoria, and has evidently been the model on which the Reports on the Census of 1891 issued from those departments have been based. Sometimes my own words have been used, and, perhaps from inadvertence, the users have omitted to state whence they obtained them. Of this I do not complain ; my Report was written for the benefit of the public, and I am glad to find that one section of the public, at any rate, has been able to turn it to useful account. I recognize, moreover, that upon the principle that imitation is the sincerest flattery those who appropriate my work pay an indirect compliment to myself.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1007.</h3>
				<p>It affords me much pleasure to testify to the valuable services rendered by Mr. Joseph Hart, the late chief clerk in this office, who was my principal assistant in carrying out the operations of the Census, a position which he had also occupied ten years previously. In connexion with the Census of 1891 efficient aid was given by this officer at all stages of the work, and especially in superintending the large extra staff engaged to compile the Census returns which was placed under his immediate guidance. Praise is moreover due to Mr. W. A. Cadwallader, who assisted in the work of supervision, and ably seconded Mr. Hart's exertions. Other officers on both the permanent and temporary staffs also did good work, their labours being often prolonged beyond business hours. The zeal and assiduity displayed by all concerned largely contributed to the success of the important national undertaking which the Government and Parliament of this colony intrusted to my charge.</p>
			
			<p>I have the honour to be,</p>
			<p>Sir,</p>
			<p>Your most obedient Servant,</p>
			<p>HENRY HEYLYN HAYTER,</p>
			<p>Government Statist.</p>
			<p>NOTE.—The facts and figures in this Report have been checked by or under the supervision of Mr. J. J. Fenton, of this office. In pursuance of this duty much thoughtful care has been exercised, and I do not think it probable that any important error has escaped observation. Should, however, a mistake be discovered, I shall feel obliged for information as to its nature and position.</p>

			<h1 class="section-title">DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD OF TABULATING THE CENSUS BY MEANS OF
      CARDS.</h1>
			<p>(<span class="emphasis">By Mr. Joseph Hart, late Chief Clerk in the Office of the Government Statist, Melbourne.</span>)</p>
			<p>Two classes of information were given on the Householders' Schedules, that relating to each household, which was tabulated on sheets direct from the schedules, and formed the two parts—" Inhabitants and Houses " and " Land and Live Stock." The remainder of the information related to each individual, and for compiling this a separate card was used for each person, and the particulars given on the schedule were transcribed on the cards.<div class="footnote">* 
					<p>A copy of the card is given on page 15,<span class="emphasis">ante.</span></p>
				</div></p>
			<p>The first line of the card referred to the place in which the person lived that the card referred to, which was indicated by numbers ; there was also provision for the number of the schedule in case reference had to be made. The second line indicated the conjugal condition by a stroke being made through the abbreviation which referred to the person. The age was stated on the next line, and the religion on the next. It will be noticed that the letters " S.", " T." appear on the line set apart for religion ; a stroke through the letter " S." indicated that the person was a Sunday-school scholar, and through the letter " T." that he or she was a Sunday-school teacher. The education was also expressed by a stroke through one of the abbreviations—" R.W." standing for read and write, " R.O." read only, " C.R." cannot read.</p>
			<p>The occupation was stated in full, as given on the schedule ; but as some occupations did not distinctly state whether the person was a maker or a dealer, the letters " M.D." had a stroke through them as required. The letter " E." on the last line but one was for employers of labour, " O." for those working on their own account without any assistance, " W." working for wages, and " U." unemployed, a stroke through either of these letters indicating to which class the person belonged.</p>
			<p>A photo reduction of a sheet actually used in the tabulation of these particulars is given on page 17.</p>
			<p>This sheet refers to the males in the portion of South Gippsland Census, or Electoral District within Alberton Shire, all being in the county of Buln Buln. The number 38 was assigned to this district. The subdivision numbers in the corner of the sheet refer to the more minute divisions used in the first tabulation, and indicated which bundles of cards were to be combined for this tabulation.</p>
			<p>The district dealt with contained a male population of 3,503. The first operation was to sort into birthplaces. In doing this it was ascertained that there were eight Chinese ; the cards referring to these were handed to the person engaged on tabulating the Chinese, leaving 3,495 cards to be dealt with, a note being made on the corner of the sheet of the number of card referring to Chinese which had been taken out.</p>
			<p>The numbers born in each of the places named in the first part of the sheet were next set down. Some of the columns, it will be noticed, refer to more than one country ; for instance, the eighth, referring to Fiji and New Guinea (other Australasian colonies), the fourteenth to Gibraltar and Malta (other European British Possessions), the thirty-fourth to other countries. To obtain detailed information relative to these, another card was made out for each person born in any of the countries so grouped. These cards were coloured green to easily distinguish them from the others, and the only particulars given in them were the name of the birthplace and the reference figures given on the top line of the card. Other green cards, which were exact copies of the original cards, were made out for natives of France, Italy, and Austria, the Governments of those countries having asked for information respecting their subjects. In this sheet there were in all 37 of the duplicate green cards, or about 1 per cent. of the whole. A clerk with a good knowledge of geography was chosen to deal with these, to whom the tabulators handed all the duplicate cards relating to birthplaces.</p>
			<p>The next division on the sheet refers to religions. The cards were sorted into all religions named in the headings, and the same plan was adopted as in the birthplaces, to obtain particulars of the details of the minor sects. Only twelve duplicate cards were required in this district to tabulate this information.</p>
			<p>Whilst the cards were in piles of each religion, those relating to Sunday-school teachers and scholars (which was indicated by a stroke through one of the letters " S." " T." on the line for religion) were sorted out, the number of teachers of each religious denomination was then set down, and as these were all over the age of 14 years, the cards relating to them could then be considered as done with so far as religion was concerned. The Sunday-school scholars were next set down under each denomination, and then sorted into ages, without regard to denomination, the result being set down on the top line of the Age division. The cards referring to these scholars between the ages of 5 and 14 last birthday were then sorted back into religions, and the remainder of the piles of each religion looked through for all between 5 and 14, which were added to the Sunday-school scholars of those ages. The cards were then sorted to ascertain the degree of education acquired by the children of each denomination. As they were counted and set down they were arranged in four piles, namely, read and write, read only, cannot read, and unspecified education. When the whole were completed, the read-and-write pile contained 474 cards.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_285"></div>
			<p>the read-only pile 30, the cannot-read pile 46, and the unspecified 80. It is evident that these figures must agree with those in the column Total from 5 to 14, in the part of the sheet devoted to Age and Education. To complete the details relating to the education of the children referred to, the four piles were divided into single ages. The result being entered under the proper headings, the addition of the four lines gives the total at each age.</p>
			<p>In sheets referring to males the figures in this line could be repeated in the line provided for those " Never Married," but in the sheet relating to females, it was necessary to look through those relating to girls of 13 and 14 years of age, in case any should be set down as married.</p>
			<p>Whilst the cards were arranged in ages, each age was again divided into the following division, and the result set down. The first line refers to those living with their parents, about whose occupation nothing was stated on the schedule ; the second to those set down as visitors without any other particulars ; the third, " Other Dependents," included inmates of charitable institutions, not attending school, or following any trade, and children stated to be lodgers, without anything being set down as to their occupation. The four next lines refer to those receiving education, namely, those attending private schools, those attending State schools, those being taught at home, and those set down on the schedule as scholars, or attending school, without any information being given as to the school they were attending. The last line refers to those who were following some trade or employment to support themselves.</p>
			<p>In the sheet of which a copy is given there are entries referring to 630 boys from 5 to 15. As the cards of each age were taken up, they were sorted into all the above divisions. When this was completed it was found that there were 592 cards referring to the dependent class which could be considered as done with, and 38 referring to bread-winners were set aside for future tabulation.</p>
			<p>Going back to the other cards, which had been duly dealt with as far as birthplaces and religious were concerned, the next operation was to sort them into the various single ages and the groups of ages given on the heading of that portion of the sheet referring to ages.</p>
			<p>The work connected with those under 5 years of age, after sorting with single ages, differed in no way from that already described, excepting that none were set down as able to read under 3, nor able to read, and write under 5, and no cards set aside as referring to bread-winners.</p>
			<p>The plan of finishing one age or group of ages when taken in hand was adopted all through, and when all the different headings of information had been filled, those referring to bread-winners were tied up in bundles, or placed in boxes, of the groups of ages given on the last line of the sheet, and were then handed in with the sheets (the cards referring to dependents being kept separate). After examination, the bundles or boxes of cards referring to bread-winners were placed in pigeon-holes or divisions, there being a separate division for each group of ages, and four sets of these groups, namely, Males in Metropolitan Districts, Females in Metropolitan Districts, Males in Country Districts, and Females in Country Districts.</p>
		
		
			<h1 class="section-title">TABULATING OCCUPATIONS.</h1>
			<p>The cards in each compartment, previously referred to, were then given out for abstracting the information relating to occupations ; to accomplish this, sets of sheets were provided (128 sheets in each set) printed with the lines far enough apart to admit of their being cut in slips. In these sheets every occupation returned in former Censuses was set down in alphabetical order, and the order, sub-order, and number of line in each sub-order being printed on the left hand, against each occupation. A few lines from one of those sheets is given below, which will give a good idea of the whole set :—</p>
			<table border="1" summary="VIC-1891-census_02-15_285-1"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>T.</th><th>E.</th><th>O.</th><th>W.</th><th>U.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>Picture-frame dealer</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>Pie hawker</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>Pier master, officer, clerk, watchman</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>Pig dealer, salesman</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>Pig breeder, keeper, minder</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
			<p>There was a set of these sheets for each group of ages in the four divisions already referred to. The first column " T." was for the total, which was obtained by addition of the other entries, and could be checked by counting the cards entered on each line. The next column " E." referred to those who were employers of others, the column " O." to those working on their own account without employing others, the column " W." to those working for wages, and the column " U." to those who were unemployed for a week or more preceding the day on which the Census was taken.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_286"></div>
			<p>In addition to these, twenty other sets of sheets, headed with the groups of ages as given in Table VII., Part IX., " Occupations of the People," were used. These sets consisted of—</p>
			<table border="1" summary="VIC-1891-census_02-15_286-1"><tbody><tr><th>1. Metropolitan Districts</th><td>Males</td><td>Total.</td></tr><tr><th>2. Metropolitan Districts</th><td>Males</td><td>Employers.</td></tr><tr><th>3. Metropolitan Districts</th><td>Males</td><td>Own account.</td></tr><tr><th>4.

Country Districts</th><td>Females</td><td>Own account.</td></tr><tr><th>19. Country Districts</th><td>Females</td><td>Working for wages.</td></tr><tr><th>20. Country Districts</th><td>Females</td><td>Unemployed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
			<p>The figures on the first sets of sheets, referring to each age, after having been checked with the Age sheets, were transcribed to the respective columns on these sheets.</p>
			<p>From combinations of these sheets all the tables in Part IX. were prepared. When the information was all transcribed, each set of sheets was cut into slips with an ordinary card-cutting machine, all blank lines being cast aside. The slips when cut were first arranged into orders, the order being indicated by the figure in the left-hand column ; each order was then sorted into sub-orders, according to the figure in the second column ; these were again arranged for lines, according to the third figure ; if any further information was needful for notes to any line, it only had to be copied from these sheets. The slips when arranged were pasted on to sheets. A photo reduction of a completed sheet is given on page 18. This refers to males only, and the information so obtained is embodied in Table VIII., Part IX., " Occupations of the People" ; the portion that this sheet refers to is the last fifteen lines of page 77, and the nine first lines of page 78. It will be noticed that the letters " T.," " E.," " O.," " W.," " U.," occur twice on this sheet ; the two slips on which they appear were the first lines on pages 123 and 79 of the alphabetical sets of sheets before referred to. It will be also noticed that had any detailed notes been required to this table they would easily have been made ; for instance, the 5,113 males set down on page 78 as " butcher," " meat salesman," consist of—5,040 who returned themselves as butchers, 6 as shipping butchers, 4 set themselves down as fleshers, 10 as meat salesmen, 43 pork butchers, and 1 small-goods dealer.</p>
			<p>Before concluding, it may be well to refer to the manner in which the custody of such a large number of cards was carried on. The cards when supplied were in boxes of 500. These boxes were made of straw board with tin corners ; the cost being 3½d. a box. When the information was entered on the cards, if the whole box referred to one place, the name of the divisions was written on the end of the box, and the cards not tied ; but if cards related to more than one division, or parts of two divisions, they were tied in bundles, and each bundle labeled, the end of the box being also labeled.</p>
			<p>These boxes were placed in divisions on shelves, each division holding nine boxes, namely, three high and three wide, the labeled ends showing outwards, and the name of the Census district, and then numbers of the divisions, being placed on each compartment. A clerk had charge of the whole cards, and made an entry of all taken out or returned. About 3,000 of these boxes were used.</p>
			<p>Counting machines were used in the early part of the compilation, but the use of them to some extent was given up, one of the greatest difficulties being the returning the cards to their proper boxes ; this of course could be got over by having properly trained employes. The plan intended to be adopted was, that when the cards were sorted into the different headings required, a red card should be placed between each heading, and then taken to the machine for counting, the machinist making a note of the number showing in the machine as each red card passed ; then by deducting the numbers so obtained from the one above, the figures for setting down in the sheet would be arrived at, of course making an allowance for the red dividing cards. It was found better, in most cases, for the clerks sorting the cards to make all the entries, but where the numbers were large the machines were used with advantage. After the other work was done, the whole of the cards were passed through the machines to obtain the numbers at each single age. This was done without much difficulty, but not as fast as at the trial of the counting machines before the Census was taken, when 676 cards were put through in two minutes, some delay being occasioned by the cards not being all of a perfectly uniform size.</p>
			<p>With cards cut quite true, as many as 250 to 300 cards a minute could be easily counted.</p>

		<p>NOTE.—In this table the numbers under 21 and over 85 were tabulated in single ages, and the remainder in quinquennial periods of age. The latter were then divided into single years of age by a process of graduation. An estimate was also made of the ages of those persons whose ages were not specified in the householders' schedules. Where the minus sign (-) is prefixed, a decrease took place between the periods.—</p>

		<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO ENUMERATORS.</p>
		<p>(<span class="emphasis">Issued with the approval of the Minister, under Section 7 of the Census Act 1891.</span>)</p>
		
			<h1 class="appendix-1-title">SUBDIVISION OF DISTRICT.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
				<p>In the first instance it will be necessary that the enumerator should proceed to divide his district into sub-districts. This he should do without delay, in order that such subdivision may be submitted for the approval of the Governor in Council.
						<span class="annotation"> [Formation of sub-districts.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>In performing this duty he will bear in mind the following points, and adhere as closely as possible to the principles laid down for his guidance.
						<span class="annotation"> [Points to be observed.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>In all cities, towns, and boroughs, and, where possible, also in shires, the country is to be so divided into sub-districts as to admit of all the schedules being called for on Monday and Tuesday, the 6th and 7th of April. In scattered country districts more time may be allowed, but the subdivision should be such that it may be possible to get in all the returns by Saturday, the 11th April, at the latest.
						<span class="annotation"> [Collection, where possible, to be made in two days.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>In apportioning the work the enumerator must consider the distance to be traversed by the sub-enumerator in going from dwelling to dwelling, and must so form the sub-districts as to comprise more dwellings when they lie near together, and fewer when they lie far apart.
						<span class="annotation"> [Sub-districts to be formed with regard to distance apart of dwellings.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>Thus in a town where the houses adjoin, or are only a few yards apart, the number included in the sub-district may be from 150 to 200 inhabited houses ; in suburban districts and villages or gold-fields, where the dwellings are still near, although further apart than in a closely built town, the number may be from 100 to 150 ; in the more settled agricultural districts, where there is occasionally a distance of more than half-a-mile between one dwelling and the next nearest, the number may be from 50 to 100 ; and in the more scattered agricultural districts, where intervals of two miles or upwards intervene between some dwellings and others, less than 50 may be included in a sub-district. As regards the arrangements for collecting in scattered country districts or enumerating small bodies of miners engaged in prospecting, &amp;c., the special circumstances of each locality must be taken into account, both as regards the time to be allowed and the number of habitations to be allotted to each sub-enumerator.
						<span class="annotation"> [Number of dwellings to be included in a sub-district.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
				<p>It is essential to the accuracy of the enumeration that the sub-districts be well defined and clearly described, so that no doubt may exist among the sub-enumerators as to which sub-district any one house may belong, and that there may be no chance of the inmates being, through any such doubt, either omitted or numbered twice over ; it is therefore impressed upon the enumerator that this can only be done effectually
						<span class="annotation"> [Well-marked boundaries to be adopted.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_456"></div>
			<p>by adopting well-marked natural or artificial boundaries, such as creeks, the waterflow of gullies, streets, fenced-in or well-beaten roads, lines of electric telegraph, &amp;c. Imaginary lines drawn from point to point on maps are inadmissible except in extreme cases.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>The pink subdividing lines with which the map is crossed indicate the boundaries of counties, cities, towns, boroughs, shires, wards, ridings, and electoral divisions, and in forming the sub-districts it is important that these lines should be crossed as seldom as possible. Where a sub-district necessarily extends into more than one of these pink-bordered subdivisions, the sub-enumerator must be instructed that not only must every schedule be carefully marked with its proper subdivisional number as given on the map, but the schedules relating to each separate subdivision must be kept apart from those of any other.
						<span class="annotation"> [Pink-bordered subdivisions.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
				<p>To avoid confusion of boundaries, the enumerator must mark and number his sub-districts in black ink, or some other colour widely different from the pink with which the subdivisions just referred to are marked and numbered.
						<span class="annotation"> [Sub-districts not to be marked in pink.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator will bear in mind that the sub-districts into which he divides his district must together form the whole of that district, and that no part is to be left out under the assumption that it is uninhabited.
						<span class="annotation"> [The whole district to be subdivided.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
				<p>He will also understand that it is expedient that every sub-district should be one connected portion of country, and should not consist of two or more detached portions.
						<span class="annotation"> [Each sub-district to be in one block.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
				<p>Having arranged the formation of the sub-districts in conformity with the foregoing instructions, the enumerator must, before the 14th February, 1891, return to this office one of the two maps sent, with his plan of subdivision clearly marked thereon ; and must also transmit with such map one of the forms headed " Enumerator's Schedule A" with the information required respecting the proposed subdivision duly entered, taking care first to mark the other map and fill the other " Schedule A" in the same manner for his own guidance.
						<span class="annotation"> [Map and " Schedule A " to be returned.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
				<p>A description of the boundaries of the district is sent with the maps, and it is necessary, to prevent mistakes on the part of the sub-enumerators, that the enumerator should write similar descriptions of their sub-districts in their respective books, which will be sent shortly.
						<span class="annotation"> [Sub-districts to be described in sub-enumerators' books.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
				<p>Where thought necessary, maps of the sub-enumerators' districts will be furnished, which must be pasted on the inside of the covers of the sub-enumerators' books.
						<span class="annotation"> [Sub-enumerators' maps.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
				<p>In connexion with the period to be allowed for collection, as already referred to, that of distribution is to be considered ; and experience has shown that in cities, towns, and boroughs, and other densely peopled districts, where the sub-enumerators act on foot, one day for leaving the schedules is sufficient, thus accomplishing the work by the labour of three days, viz., one for distribution and two for collection ; but where the population is more scattered, and the greater portion of the time is occupied in travelling from house to house, it will be necessary to allow an equal, or nearly equal, time for distribution and collection.
						<span class="annotation"> [Time allowed for distributing forms.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">15.</h3>
				<p>In case of any doubt or dispute as to the exact boundary line between his own and an adjoining district, the enumerator is recommended to communicate with the enumerator of that district, and to enter into such arrangement as will enable the sub-enumerators acting on either side of the boundary to act in accordance, so that neither omissions or overlapping may occur. The enumerator is charged to take every precaution that the persons he has appointed act in concord with each other and with the sub-enumerators of adjoining districts.
						<span class="annotation"> [Doubt as to boundaries.] </span>
					</p>
			
		
		
			<h1 class="appendix-1-title">APPOINTMENT OF SUB-ENUMERATORS.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
				<p>Having arranged the subdivision of his district, the next matter to occupy the attention of the enumerator is the selection of as many sub-enumerators as there are sub-districts.
						<span class="annotation"> [Selection of sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">17.</h3>
				<p>The principal duties of the sub-enumerators are described in the eighth to the eleventh, and the sixteenth to the twentieth sections of the Census Act, and in the more detailed instructions which have been drawn up for their guidance. With these clauses and instructions the enumerator should make himself perfectly familiar.
						<span class="annotation"> [Duties of sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
				<p>To fulfil his duties properly the sub-enumerator must be a person of intelligence and activity, must not be less than eighteen years of age, must read and write well, and must be sufficiently healthy and strong to undergo the exertion of performing his task with promptness ; he must be of temperate habits and of sufficiently good address to convey all the requisite information concerning the census in a manner calculated to obtain the good-will and co-operation of the inhabitants. It will likewise be necessary that he should be well acquainted with the sub-district in which he is required to act.
						<span class="annotation"> [Qualifications of sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
				<p>It is further desirable that each sub-enumerator should live in or near his own sub-district, so that he may not have the additional labour of going far from home before he can begin his duties. This rule, however, is not prescribed as one to which a rigid adherence is required, but on which the enumerator must exercise his discretion, remembering that character and fitness are most to be considered.
						<span class="annotation"> [Sub-enumerators should live in their sub-districts.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_457"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">20.</h3>
				<p>The sub-enumerators are of two classes, those acting on horseback and those acting on foot. The former are not to be appointed in any city, town, or borough, and in country districts only where the population is scattered and a considerable distance has to be traveled in going from house to house. When mounted sub-enumerators are employed, it will be the enumerator's duty to see that horses are actually used, and that the Government is not improperly charged with the extra allowance paid to that class of officers when the work has been performed on foot.
						<span class="annotation"> [Horse and foot sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">21.</h3>
				<p>Should there be any large number of Chinese in his district it will be the enumerator's duty to endeavour to obtain the services of persons qualified to act as interpreters, who, if in other respects suitable, may be appointed as sub-enumerators for the Chinese quarters, or one such person may go round with the sub-enumerator to the dwellings of the Chinese to interpret their replies for his information in filling the schedules.
						<span class="annotation"> [Chinese interpreters.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">22.</h3>
				<p>The employment of sub-enumerators has been sanctioned upon the following scale :—Sub-enumerators acting on horseback, not exceeding £1 per diem ; sub-enumerators acting on foot, not exceeding 10s. per die. These are the maximum rates, but should the services of suitable persons be obtainable at, and in the opinion of the enumerator adequately remunerated with, a less sum, he will bear in mind that it is his duty to economize the cost of the census as much as possible.
						<span class="annotation"> [Rate of payment to sub-enumerators.] </span>

				<p>In making arrangements with the sub-enumerators the enumerator will understand that no payment is to be allowed them for the time occupied in receiving their instructions from him, or giving up their returns after the census is over ; half-a-day, however, at the rate allowed to sub-enumerators acting on foot, may be allowed for completing and summarizing the entries in the sub-enumerator's book. Thus, in cities, towns, and boroughs, as well as in other districts where the time allowed for depositing and collecting the schedules is limited to three days, the maximum total time for which payment may be promised is three and a half days.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">24.</h3>
				<p>Having obtained a sufficient number of persons willing to serve as sub-enumerators in his district, and having satisfied himself as to their fitness by making the requisite inquiries, the enumerator must, as soon as the arrangements made in Schedule. A have been recommended for approval, prepare a list to be submitted to the Governor in Council on the form headed " Enumerator's Schedule B," stating the name, age, and occupation of each person, the number and name, if any, of the sub-district to which it is proposed to appoint him, also whether he resides in, or in the immediate neighbourhood of such sub-district.

				<p>The enumerator is prohibited from acting himself as a sub-enumerator except in the extreme case of one of the sub-enumerators failing at the last moment, and his being unable to procure another person to take his place. Under such circumstances the enumerator must immediately report the matter to the Government Statist, and, without waiting for a reply, must undertake the collection himself, taking care, however, that in so doing he does not omit to exercise a proper supervision over the regular sub-enumerators acting in his district.

			<h1 class="appendix-1-title">GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">26.</h3>
				<p>Having compiled with the requirements of the Census Act, so far as the subdivision of his district and the selection of sub-enumerators is concerned, and having performed the duties appertaining thereto in accordance with the foregoing instructions, the enumerator will ascertain that all his sub-enumerators understand their duties and how the business of enumeration is to be performed, affording them all requisite information and explanation.
						<span class="annotation"> [Sub-enumerators' duties to be explained.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">27.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator must obtain the signature of each person accepting the office of sub-enumerator to a copy of the First Schedule of the Census Act, for which purpose forms are supplied, taking care to warn him previously to acceptance that he will not subsequently be at liberty, under a penalty of £20, to refuse the office or to neglect the performance of his duties unless incapacitated by illness or other lawful cause. These documents must be retained by the enumerator until the enumeration has been completed.
						<span class="annotation"> [Declaration to be subscribed by sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">28.</h3>
				<p>In addition to the declaration referred to the enumerator must, after his arrangements as detailed in Schedule A have been recommended for approval, give to each sub-enumerator one of the forms of " Sub-enumerator's Appointment" duly filled up and signed by himself ; and after inserting the same particulars in the form " Sub-enumerator's Acceptance of Office" he must require the sub-enumerator to read over and sign it. The enumerator must take care that the times and rates of payment entered in these forms agree exactly with those embodied in " Schedule A," and will also be sure to make each sub-enumerator aware that he is bound to complete the enumeration of his sub-district without additional pay whether he is able to do it within the time specified or not. The forms of " Sub-enumerator's Acceptance of Office" the enumerator must retain until the whole of the work has been completed and the sub-enumerators have been paid.
						<span class="annotation"> [Agreements with sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">29.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator must also make known to all those he appoints that no person employed on the Census will be entitled to payment unless he has faithfully performed his duties.

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_458"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">30.</h3>
				<p>Should the enumerator deem it advisable, for any reason, to remove a sub-enumerator after his appointment, or should any sub-enumerator be incapacitated from acting, the enumerator must at once appoint another to the vacancy, and report the same for the approval of the Governor in Council.
						<span class="annotation"> [Removal, &amp;c., of sub-enumerator.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">31.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator must deliver to each sub-enumerator as many householders' schedules and as many educational schedules as there are dwellings in his sub-district, together with some spare ones of both kinds to provide against miscalculations or losses. He must also supply him with a copy of the " Instructions to Sub-enumerators" and with one of the sub-enumerator's books.
						<span class="annotation"> [Forms to be given to sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">32.</h3>
				<p>During the period the actual work of the census is going on, the enumerator must use every exertion which the circumstances of his district will admit of to observe how the different sub-enumerators perform their duties, and must avail himself of the knowledge he possesses of each sub-district to ascertain whether any places are omitted which ought to be visited.
						<span class="annotation"> [Sub-enumerators to be supervised.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">33.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator will bear in mind that he is required to receive the householders' schedules of his sub-enumerators the day after each of them has completed the collection. As they are received he must examine them separately, and see that they are properly filled, and in case of mistakes of any kind must insist on their being rectified. He must see that a correct record of the places is entered on the lines on the upper part of the schedule, and especially that the numbers of the subdivisions (coloured pink on the map) are in every case accurately inserted, also that the sub-enumerator's book is correctly made up. As the enumerator has the selection of his sub-enumerators, he is responsible for their being competent to perform their work properly, and must supply all deficiencies.
						<span class="annotation"> [Returns from sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">34.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator must make out a summary of the total lines of the books given in by his sub-enumerators on the form headed " Enumerator's Schedule C," and supply the other information required to be entered in that document, and must transmit the whole to the Government Statist within two days of his having received all his sub-enumerator's returns.
						<span class="annotation"> [" Enumerator's Schedule C."] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">35.</h3>
				<p>The educational schedules should either be returned with the householders' schedules or as soon after as practicable. The enumerator is not expected to make a minute examination of those documents, neither are the sub-enumerators required to make any summary of or extract from their contents.
						<span class="annotation"> [Educational schedules.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">36.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator is expected to see that each sub-enumerator duly accounts for all the documents he receives, and returns those which are not required.
						<span class="annotation"> [Schedules to be accounted for.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">37.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator must carefully attend to the requirements contained in the twelfth section of the Census Act, respecting the time and mode of transmitting the schedules and other documents, taking care that every parcel has clearly recorded on it the name of the municipal or census district, and the number of the sub-district to which it belongs, and is well and securely made up, and in such sized parcels as the postmaster of the district may deem expedient.
						<span class="annotation"> [Returning documents to Government Statist.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">38.</h3>
				<p>The householders' and educational schedules are not to be forwarded in the same bundle, but those of either kind are to be made up separately.
						<span class="annotation"> [Documents not to be mixed.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">39.</h3>
				<p>It will be the duty of the enumerator to take such steps as may be required by the Treasury to procure payment of all those employed under him, and to see to the filling up and signing of the necessary certificates and vouchers for that purpose.
						<span class="annotation"> [Payment of sub-enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">40.</h3>
				<p>The sum allowed as payment for the enumerator is in full of all charges (including stationery) and to cover all his expenses, and he is not to incur any liability on behalf of the Government not to commit the Government to any expenditure without leave first asked and obtained, except in cases of extreme emergency, which must be at once reported to the Government Statist.
						<span class="annotation"> [Enumerators not to incur liability on behalf of the Government.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">41.</h3>
				<p>Should the enumerator be prevented by sudden illness or other unavoidable cause from carrying out the task intrusted to him, he will communicate the fact to the Government Statist without delay, but should there not be sufficient time to appoint a successor he will at once depute a person to act for him, subject to the subsequent approval of the Governor in Council.
						<span class="annotation"> [Sudden illness, &amp;c., of enumerators.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">42.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator will remember, and will strongly impress upon the sub-enumerators, that by the nineteenth section of the Census Act the householders' and educational schedules are confidential documents, and their contents are not to be divulged under a penalty not exceeding Twenty pounds. He will also understand that no summary or abstract of the information collected in his district is to be supplied to the press or to any individual.
						<span class="annotation"> [Information not to be divulged.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">43.</h3>
				<p>Letters are not to be enclosed in the parcels of schedules, as the latter are not always opened until some days after their arrival at the Census Office. All letters, parcels, packets, and telegrams are to be addressed to " The Government Statist, Melbourne," and are to be marked with the word " Census," in accordance with the fourteenth section of the Act, which provides that communications so made shall be transmitted and delivered free of postage or charges.

			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_459"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">44.</h3>
				<p>The enumerator will understand that communications should, whenever possible, be made by letter in preference to telegram, the latter being only used in urgent cases not admitting of the delay incident on the transmission of a letter ; also that when telegrams are sent the matter is to be condensed into as few words as possible.

			<p>HENRY HEYLYN HAYTER,</p>
			<p>Government Statist.</p>
			<p>Census Office,</p>
			<p>Melbourne, 3rd January, 1891.</p>
		
	
	
		<h1 class="appendix-title">APPENDIX C.</h1>
		<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO SUB-ENUMERATORS.</p>
		<p>(<span class="emphasis">Issued with the approval of the Minister, under Section 7 of the Census Act 1891.</span>)</p>
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
			<p>The present Census embraces inquiries not only respecting the population and live stock, to be embodied in the householder's schedule, but respecting educational matters, to be embodied in a schedule specially devoted to that subject. The sub-enumerator, whilst endeavouring to obtain accurate information for embodiment in both these schedules, will bear in mind that the information for the householder's schedule is the more important, and to secure it correctly should be his first consideration.
					<span class="annotation"> [Census inquiries.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
			<p>The sub-enumerator will, after his appointment, receive from his enumerator a sufficient number of householders' and educational schedules for distribution. These he must number consecutively, and head with the names of places for which lines are provided, and must take especial care that the number of the subdivision (pink on the enumerator's map) is entered correctly in the proper space on the householder's schedule. He must also make himself acquainted with the manner in which the entries are to be made by the householders and others ; and if the directions given do not appear clear to him, he must consult the enumerator, whose duty it is to afford him the requisite instructions.
					<span class="annotation"> [Householders' schedules to be headed.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
			<p>To assist the sub-enumerator in thoroughly comprehending the boundaries of his sub-district, a map will be supplied in cases where it is considered necessary. Should the sub-enumerator, however, still entertain any doubt about the boundaries, he should confer with his enumerator or with the sub-enumerators of the sub-districts adjoining his, so that he may neither omit any portion of his own sub-district nor enter into that of any other sub-enumerator.
					<span class="annotation"> [Boundaries of sub-district.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
			<p>He should also thoroughly master these instructions, and those printed upon the schedules, and should carefully read over those sections of the Act describing his duty and obligations.
					<span class="annotation"> [Instructions, sections, Regulations, &amp;c.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
			<p>On Saturday, the 4th April, or in course of as many other of the days preceding as the enumerator may direct, the sub-enumerator is to leave at every dwelling-place in his sub-district one or more householders' and educational schedules, according to the number of persons or separate families residing in such dwelling. On leaving the schedules, he should state that they will be called for early in the following week ; and should specially inform masters or persons in charge of hotels, lodging-houses, and the like that they will be required to give full particulars respecting every person who abode in their houses on the night of Sunday, the 5th April. As every householder's and educational schedule is to be numbered prior to distribution, the sub-enumerator will be able to observe, when going over the ground a second time, whether he has omitted to collect any left by him.
					<span class="annotation"> [Distribution of schedules.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
			<p>On the morning of Monday, the 6th April, the sub-enumerator, taking with him some blank schedules of both kinds, for the purpose of supplying omissions in the distribution, or to use in place of those lost or injured, also a bottle of ink and some pens, will proceed to revisit every habitation or other place at which he has left a schedule in the sub-district assigned to him, and must continue his work on the following day or days until the whole of the forms left have been recovered. If he cannot complete the collection of his sub-district within the time allowed by the enumerator, and mentioned in his agreement, he is nevertheless bound to continue until he has finished the work.
					<span class="annotation"> [Recovery of schedules.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
			<p>At each place visited the schedules previously left must be asked for, and, when they are given, the sub-enumerator must ascertain if they contain all the particulars required ; and, if not, he must endeavour to obtain such further information as is necessary. He must be careful to ask if all the persons entered on the householder's schedule who, on the night of the 5th April, slept in the house, or in the part thereof which is occupied by the person making the return ; also, whether any members of the family or household who were absent on that night are included ; and, if so, he must strike them out, initialing such alteration, and writing the word " absent" on the margin.
					<span class="annotation"> [Information to be completed.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
			<p>He should likewise inquire if any person was temporarily absent on the night of the 5th April, and whether there is reason to suppose, in consequence of such person being in the bush travelling on that
					<span class="annotation"> [Inmate temporarily absent.] </span>
				</p>
		
		<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_460"></div>
		<p>night, or on account of his being out fishing, or on watch, or working in a mine or elsewhere, he may not have been recorded. If this should turn out to be the case, the sub-enumerator should make an entry on a separate householder's schedule of such particulars as would have been furnished respecting such person had he been at home, so far as they can be ascertained, with a note stating the cause of absence, &amp;c. This schedule the sub-enumerator will enter in his book on the page opened for travellers, roving aborigines, &amp;c.</p>
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
			<p>He must see whether a householder's schedule is a return for the whole house or for a part of it only, and in case the house is occupied by more than one family he must obtain returns for the other part or parts of it upon separate schedules. When two or more householders' schedules are used for a house, the sub-enumerator must pin them together at the upper left-hand corner, and must take care that the description of the house, &amp;c., is entered on the outside schedule only, striking it out from all the others and inserting instead the words " Second Schedule," " Third Schedule," in the " Dwelling" column. In making this alteration, he must be sure that he does not omit to record upon the First Schedule the full number of rooms contained in the house.
					<span class="annotation"> [House occupied by several families.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
			<p>Whenever the sub-enumerator is unable to obtain back any of the schedules he deposited, by reason of their being defaced or lost, he must put the requisite questions to the inmates, and insert the information on one or more of the spare schedules he takes with him from the answers given. The substituted forms may be marked with the same number as the original ones, with the addition of the word " substituted" after such number.
					<span class="annotation"> [Schedule defaced or lost.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
			<p>Should persons refuse to make written returns or to answer such questions as the sub-enumerator is authorized to put, he may remind them of the penalty to which they are rendering themselves liable, and point out the caution at the head of the schedules. He may also warn persons whom he may suspect of giving false information of the penalty they are incurring by so doing. Should they still persist in refusing to supply information, or in supplying it untruly, he must report the matter to his enumerator, in order that the requisite steps may be taken to enforce compliance with the law.
					<span class="annotation"> [Refusal to supply information.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
			<p>If a house in which some one resides is found locked up, a householder's and educational schedule must be placed under the door or left with a neighbour. If, on returning for the schedules, the sub-enumerator should find the house still empty, and that the papers have not been left out for him, he must call again and endeavour to meet with the occupier. Should he be unable to do so after several attempts, he must fill schedules from information obtained from one of the neighbours or some other person acquainted with the inmates, in which case the house may be considered as properly visited. He must, however, take care that no persons are recorded in this manner who did not actually abide in the house on the census night.
					<span class="annotation"> [Householder absent.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
			<p>The sub-enumerator must not omit to enter persons on the householders' schedules because he cannot obtain all the information respecting them. If, for example, he can learn no more than that a person who has since gone away, and whose name is unknown, slept in a house or camped out in a certain place on the night of the 5th April, he must fill a schedule for such person, writing " not known" in the column where the name should be, always stating the sex, and adding such other particulars of age, &amp;c., as can be ascertained or estimated.
					<span class="annotation"> [Failure to obtain full information.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
			<p>The descriptions of all houses intended for residences, which may be uninhabited or in course of erection at the date of taking the census, are to be entered on householders' schedules in the proper column, with the word " uninhabited" or " building," as the case may be, added. Such schedules are to be signed by the sub-enumerator. No account is to be taken of buildings, such as churches, stores, &amp;c., in which nobody sleeps, and which are not used or intended to be used as dwellings.
					<span class="annotation"> [Uninhabited and unfinished houses.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">15.</h3>
			<p>Unless some one sleeps therein, shops, bathrooms, pantries, and outhouses are not to be considered as rooms. In the case of public offices, banks, stores, &amp;c., in which a person or family resides in order to take care of the premises, the number of rooms occupied by such person or family is to be given only, and not the whole number in the building.
					<span class="annotation"> [Rooms.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
			<p>In the event of the precise number of live stock kept not being known to any householder, the sub-enumerator may inform him of that provision in the Census Act which prescribes that no penalty shall be enforced on persons who, in that case, give an estimated or approximate number as near to the truth as they are able to arrive at.<div class="footnote">* 
					<p>Extract from the Census Act, section 15, which prescribes that persons making a false return shall be liable to a penalty of Twenty pounds :— "No penalty shall be enforced against any person who, not being aware of the precise number of his live stock, shall give, in respect thereof, an estimate or reasonable approximation to the truth."</p>
				</div>He will also explain to the householder that the whole number of stock on the premises he occupies and the lands attached thereto is to be returned, whether the property of himself or of others, also those belonging to him running upon commons, or unfenced land, or in paddocks of which there is no person in charge. Those, however, placed in accommodation paddocks with resident occupiers, or on other properties where they are under the temporary custody of a different person, are not to be returned by him, but by such person.
					<span class="annotation"> [Live stock.] </span>
				</p>
		
		<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_461"></div>
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">17.</h3>
			<p>All the live stock kept under his own charge by any householder must be returned on his schedule without regard to whether some of such stock may be running on land which extends into other enumerators' or sub-enumerators' districts.
					<span class="annotation"> [Stock in other districts.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
			<p>The sub-enumerator is required to fill one or more schedules with particulars respecting any travellers or persons he may find camping out or sleeping under drays, &amp;c., on the census night. He should also make inquiry and furnish an estimate respecting the number, sex, &amp;c., of any such persons he may ascertain were in his sub-district on that night, but whom he did not succeed in meeting with.
					<span class="annotation"> [Travellers.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
			<p>He is also enjoined to record, as accurately as possible, the number of aborigines in his sub-district, distinguishing the men and women, and the children of either sex, and also entering such other particulars respecting their probable ages, religions, occupations, &amp;c., as he may be able to gather. In this matter he will, no doubt, receive valuable assistance from correspondents of the Central Board for the Protection of the Aborigines, persons in charge of aboriginal stations, &amp;c.
					<span class="annotation"> [Aborigines.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">20.</h3>
			<p>The householders' schedules of public institutions, such as hospitals, gaols, and the like, are to be kept separate from those of private dwellings, and distinctly marked. The schedules of licensed public houses are to be marked at the top with the word "hotel."
					<span class="annotation"> [Public Institutions.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">21.</h3>
			<p>When the sub-enumerator has collected the schedules, he must examine them at home to ascertain that all those distributed have been received, and that each schedule is properly filled. In case of omissions in either respect, he must, with the utmost promptness, take steps to supply them.
					<span class="annotation"> [Schedules to be examined.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">22.</h3>
			<p>He must then arrange the householders' schedules so that those of each separate place, and especially those of each numbered subdivision, may be together in the order of their entry in his book, after which he must complete the information required to be entered therein, and having certified to its correctness in the form provided for that purpose at the end of the book, he must deliver all to the enumerator, which must be done on the day after the collection has been completed.
					<span class="annotation"> [Book to be entered up.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">23.</h3>
			<p>The schedules are not to be folded separately, but are to be laid upon one another in their proper order, and then doubled across so as to make a convenient parcel. If the sub-district extends into two or more of the numbered subdivisions, the householders' schedules relating to each of such sub-divisions are to be kept apart and tied up separately from those of the others, each parcel having the number of the sub-district and that of the subdivision marked on the outside. The educational schedules are not to be mixed with or tied up in the same parcels as the householders' schedules.
					<span class="annotation"> [Folding up schedules.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">24.</h3>
			<p>In filling up the schedule in which the name of any enumerator or sub-enumerator occurs, the ordinary occupation of such officer is to be entered, and not the name of the office he holds in connexion with the census.
					<span class="annotation"> [Ordinary calling of enumerator, &amp;c., to be entered.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">25.</h3>
			<p>The sub-enumerator will remember that by the nineteenth section of the Census Act the schedules are confidential documents, and their contents are not to be divulged under a penalty of Twenty pounds. He will therefore be very particular that no person obtains access to them.
					<span class="annotation"> [Schedules are confidential documents.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">26.</h3>
			<p>He will further remember that according to the terms of his "Acceptance of office" he must complete his work without extra payment, whether he is able to do it in the time therein specified or not.
					<span class="annotation"> [Work must be completed without extra pay.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">27.</h3>
			<p>All householders' schedules received by the sub-enumerator must be duly accounted for in the form for that purpose at the beginning of his book, and all surplus schedules left blank after the work has been completed are to be returned to the enumerator.
					<span class="annotation"> [Schedules to be accounted for.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">28.</h3>
			<p>The sub-enumerator will distinctly understand that his payment is contingent upon his duties being properly performed, and that portion may be deducted or the whole cancelled should it be found that he has done his work in a negligent or unsatisfactory manner or has left any portion of it uncompleted.
					<span class="annotation"> [Payment contingent on good work.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">29.</h3>
			<p>In a general way, and in all questions regarding his duties, pay, &amp;c., the sub-enumerator is to address the enumerator. In urgent cases—as, for instance, should a further supply of schedules be wanted at the last moment—he may, when the enumerator is not at hand, write or telegraph direct to the Government Statist, Melbourne. In addressing either the enumerator or the Government Statist, care must be taken to mark the letters or telegrams with the word "Census," in order that they may travel free of postage or charges, in compliance with the fourteenth section of the Census Act.
					<span class="annotation"> [Communications.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">30.</h3>
			<p>The sub-enumerator will understand that communications are to be made, wherever possible, by letter in preference to telegram, the latter being used only in urgent cases not admitting of the delay incident on the transmission of a letter ; also that when telegrams are sent, the matter is to be condensed into as few words as possible.

			<h1 class="appendix-1-title">DIRECTIONS RESPECTING THE MANNER IN WHICH ENTRIES ARE TO BE
      MADE.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
				<p>The sub-enumerator, after completing the out-door portion of each day's work, should proceed during the evening to make entries in this book of the householders' schedules he has collected throughout the day, and thus keep the compilation in a forward state, so as to be able to give in his returns to the enumerator promptly the day after all have been received.
						<span class="annotation"> [Book to be written up in the evening.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>The name of the Census or Electoral District and the number of the sub-district must be stated on the first page, in addition to the name of the sub-enumerator. If the enumerator should omit to insert these particulars, the sub-enumerator is to enter them.
						<span class="annotation"> [Number, &amp;c., of sub-district.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>The subdivisional number must be entered at the top of each page ; also, that of the township, village, or locality. In case a sub-district extends to portions of more than one subdivision, the entries should be so arranged that all the schedules entered on a page may belong to the same subdivision, and when all are entered the words "End of subdivision, number - ," should be noted, and no more entries made there, but the next entries should be begun on the following page.
						<span class="annotation"> [Names of places.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>The schedules relating to portions of a township, village, &amp;c., situated within a subdivision must be kept together and entered consecutively, so that it may be possible to make up the total number of inhabitants, &amp;c., in each such portion if required.
						<span class="annotation"> [Schedules not to be mixed.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>It is only necessary to insert the name of the head of the household in the second column, and not that of any other member of the family.
						<span class="annotation"> [Name of householder] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
				<p>The number of every schedule must be entered in the proper column. If a schedule has been lost or destroyed at the house where it was left, and another substituted therefore, the letter "S" must be added after the number, and a note made of the circumstances in the column headed "Remarks," so that the missing schedule may be accounted for.
						<span class="annotation"> [Number of schedule.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>The Chinese and Aborigines contained in each schedule are to be included with the European in the two columns headed "Total Number of Persons," &amp;c., and such Chinese and Aborigines respectively, according to their sex, are then to be repeated in the subsequent columns.
						<span class="annotation"> [Chinese and Aborigines.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
				<p>If entries have been made on schedules of the exact or estimated number of travelers, roving Aborigines, or other persons not sleeping in houses during any portion of the census night, such schedules are to be abstracted on a special page after the page devoted to the returns of householders.
						<span class="annotation"> [Travellers, &amp;c.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
				<p>In all cases where houses are subdivided between different households, the fact is to be recorded in the column headed "Remarks," so as to show the number of houses as distinguished from the number of schedules.
						<span class="annotation"> [More than one family in a house.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
				<p>In case of large families, boarding schools, institutions, &amp;c., where more than one schedule has to be used for the household or inmates, the numbers in all the schedules relating to such household, school, or institution are to be entered in one line, a note of the number of schedules dealt with being made in the column for "Remarks."</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
				<p>Schedules relating to dwelling-houses which are unoccupied or being built must be entered in their proper order, and the words "uninhabited" or "building," as the case may be, must be written in the column for "Remarks."
						<span class="annotation"> [Unoccupied and unfinished houses.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
				<p>If, owing to removals or other causes, a sub-enumerator cannot recover any schedules distributed by him, he must note the circumstance opposite the missing numbers. If, on the other hand, he receives schedules distributed in other districts, he should enter them after his own, and make a note that they were distributed elsewhere.
						<span class="annotation"> [Removals.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
				<p>The additions of one page are not to be carried on to the next, but the totals of all the pages are to be copied into the summary form at the end of the book. The summary is then to be completed and added, so as to show the required particulars respecting the entire sub-district upon one line.
						<span class="annotation"> [Summary to be made.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
				<p>All householders' schedules received by the sub-enumerator are to be duly accounted for in the form provided for that purpose at the beginning of the book.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
				<p>Gentlemen employed in the Census Office, whether engaged on time or piece-work are required to conform strictly to the Public Service Regulations. They are expected to attend punctually, are not to receive visitors within the building at any time, nor to occupy themselves upon their private affairs during business hours, nor—except during half-an-hour which is allowed for luncheon, and which must be taken between noon and 1 p.m.—are they to quit the office premises during such hours, for ever so short a period, without first obtaining leave from the officer in charge. They must sign the attendance book on coming to the office in the morning and on leaving it after the day's work is over, noting the exact time of their arrival and departure.
						<span class="annotation"> [Public Service Regulations to be observed.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>Illness of a sufficiently serious character to necessitate absence from the office is to be at once reported to the Government Statist, and should such absence be prolonged for more than one day, a medical certificate is to be forwarded. Gentlemen not complying with this instruction render themselves liable to be reported as absent without leave and to have their places filled up by others.
						<span class="annotation"> [Illness to be reported.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>No fermented or spirituous liquor will be allowed to be brought into the building.

					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>Smoking in the office is strictly prohibited, either before, during, or after business hours.
						<span class="annotation"> [Smoking forbidden.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>Piece-work may be pursued before and after hours, but not by gas, lamp, or candle light, or on Saturdays after 2 p.m., or on Sundays, nor will any one be allowed to take papers out of the office.
						<span class="annotation"> [Piece-work after hours.] </span>

				<p>Officers on salary or daily pay are not allowed to take part in the piece-work, or to have any interest therein.
						<span class="annotation"> [Officers on time not to join in piece-work.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>The contents of the individual schedules are to be treated as strictly confidential, and are not to be talked about either in or outside the office, or otherwise divulged. Any one infringing this regulation renders himself not only liable to instant dismissal, but to a penalty of Twenty pounds under the Census Act.
						<span class="annotation"> [Schedules strictly confidential.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
				<p>Fines will be imposed for mistakes upon the principle that deductions from the payment are made for errors, and a certain percentage of errors may cancel the right to any payment whatever. It is, however, to be distinctly understood that if any portion of the work should be done in a grossly negligent or slovenly manner it may be at once rejected by the officer in charge (in which case no payment will be awarded) without submitting it to the ordinary examination for errors.

				<p>The householders' schedules are to be numbered in pencil or with a numbering machine at the right-hand upper corner, and the total number of persons, and of Chinese and Aborigines (if any) of either sex, included in each schedule, are to be marked in pencil thereon, half-castes of either race being distinguished. It should be remembered that the Chinese are not necessarily born in China, nor the Aborigines in Victoria, and as the sub-enumerators may sometimes omit to enter the distinguishing letters in the birthplace column, names and other circumstances must be observed to discover whether persons belong to those races.

				<p>Each sheet is to be numbered in ink at the right-hand upper corner, and is to be headed with the numbers of the census district and subdivision. The names of townships, villages, &amp;c. (not municipalities) must also be entered in the column headed "Place."
						<span class="annotation"> [Sheets to be numbered, &amp;c.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
				<p>The contents of each schedule, included its office number, are to be carefully entered, one line being devoted to a schedule ; one blank line is to be left between the last entry of the schedules relating to one place and the first entry of those relating to another, if all the entries relating to a place are upon the same sheet. If they occupy portions of two sheets, three blank lines are to be left ; if portions of three sheets, four blank lines, and so on, always leaving one more line than the place occupies sheets or portions thereof. The last line in each sheet is to be left blank.
						<span class="annotation"> [Mode of making entries.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
				<p>Half-caste Chinese and half-caste Aborigines are in the first instance to be added to the pure-blooded members of those races, and so entered, a note being made in the column headed "Place" of the numbers and sexes of such half-castes.

					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
				<p>In the case of men or women stated to be "Married" it must be observed whether an entry of the wife or husband is contained in the same schedule. If not a small cross (X) is to be placed under the head of "Absent" in the column for husband or wife, as the case may be.
						<span class="annotation"> [Husband or wife absent.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">15.</h3>
				<p>In entering schedule numbers upon the sheets, the full number of figures need only be written at the top of each sheet, and at the tens. Upon the other lines entry of the units will be sufficient. Thus :—120, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.; 130, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.

						<span class="annotation"> [Houses, part brick, part wood.] </span>
					</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
				<p>"Concrete" or "pise" houses are to be tabulated in the column for brick or stone.

					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
				<p>Where the number of rooms is given as "—rooms and shop," or "bar," the shop or bar is not to be counted as a room, unless it is stated that it is used as a sleeping apartment or for dwelling in. Bathrooms, pantries, &amp;c., are not to be counted as rooms.

				<p>The number of rooms contained in tents or huts is to be noted, as well as those in more substantial edifices ; but when the number of rooms is not mentioned, the tents and huts are to be entered as consisting of one room only, whilst the other buildings are to be tabulated in the column for "rooms not stated." Uninhabited tents or huts are not to be tabulated, but the schedules on which they are entered are to be taken to the officer in charge for cancellation.
						<span class="annotation"> [Tents or huts.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">24.</h3>
				<p>Besides entering in the proper columns the number of acres of land occupied and cultivated, and the number and various descriptions of live stock and poultry, as contained in the schedules, the sum of the live stock, and that of the poultry, must in each case be correctly carried out to the total columns.

				<p>The schedules are each day to be put perfectly straight, neatly tied up, and put in their proper place or pigeon-hole before the tabulator leaves his work ; any officer infringing this regulation will be fined one shilling. When a bundle of schedules is finished the number of the district and subdivision are to be written on the outside of the last sheet, with the signature of the tabulator, thus :—

					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">32.</h3>
				<p>If any particular required to be entered is either omitted or wrongly stated an error will be charged for every column in which such omission or wrong statement occurs, but a figure wrongly placed in one line and omitted from another will only count as one error, not as two.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">33.</h3>
				<p>Entries respecting males are to be made upon the white cards, those respecting females upon the blue ones, one card being devoted to each individual.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">35.</h3>
				<p>The cards relating to Chinese and Aborigines (including half-castes) are to be thrown out as soon as the entries are made thereon. When a subdivision is ended, these cards must be counted to see that they agree with the numbers of either race in the same place as set down in the first tabulation (Inhabitants and Houses), and afterwards placed in boxes, and put away as directed by the officer in charge. In throwing out the cards of the Chinese, care must be taken not to make the mistake of throwing out any cards relating to persons of European race born in China (E.R.).
						<span class="annotation"> [Cards of Chinese and Aborigines to be thrown out.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">36.</h3>
				<p>The line immediately under that for the numbers relates to Conjugal Condition, the abbreviations implying unmarried (never married), married, widowed, and divorced. Whichever of these stands in the schedule against the name of the individual to whom the card relates must be struck out neatly. If the conjugal condition should not be specified in the schedule, all the abbreviations must be left standing.

The remaining cards, having been sorted into ages, each heap must be first divided in regard to<span class="emphasis">Education</span>, and then as to<span class="emphasis">Conjugal Condition</span>, care being taken that the totals under each age agree with those under "All Religions" and "All Countries,"<span class="emphasis">supra</span>. The "<span class="emphasis">Occupations</span>" dealt with in this sheet only apply to "domestic duties," "dependents," and "scholars," after which are entered the remaining cards must be counted, and the numbers placed in the line "Other Occupations," the numbers being made to balance with previous totals.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">68.</h3>
				<p>The number of Sunday school scholars under each age must be entered in the proper line and columns before the arrangement in ages is disturbed. Most of these will be between 5 and 14 years of age, but a few will doubtless be either younger or older than these ages.
						<span class="annotation"> [Ages of Sunday school scholars.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">69.</h3>
				<p>The only column in this part of the tabulation requiring duplicate cards (special) for the entries is that headed "85 and upwards," the exact ages of which must be entered on the duplicates, the totals being entered in the small square a the bottom of the column.
						<span class="annotation"> [Persons over 85.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">70.</h3>
				<p>Persons whose ages are not specified, if returned as "child," "boy," "girl," &amp;c., are to be assumed to be between 5 and 14 years of age, and tabulated as "unspecified children."
						<span class="annotation"> [Children of unspecified age.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">71.</h3>
				<p>Children between 3 and 5 years of age, if stated as able to "read and write," (R.and W.), must not be so tabulated, but in the line "read only." All children under 3 are to be tabulated in the line "cannot read," although the contrary may be stated.
						<span class="annotation"> [Young children enoumeously returned.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">72.</h3>
				<p>Children whose education is not specified, if under 5 years of age, are to be tabulated in the line "cannot read ;" if they are between 5 and 7 years of age, and stated on the "occupation" line to be "scholars," or "at school," they are to be tabulated as "read only ;" if over 7 years of age, in the same case, they are to be tabulated as "read and write." If not stated to be "scholars," all children over 5 years of age whose education is not given are to be tabulated as "unspecified."
						<span class="annotation"> [Children whose education is unspecified.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">73.</h3>
				<p>Males and females under the age at which they are legally marriageable, viz., males under 14 and females under 12, are to be tabulated as "never married," although the opposite may be entered on the card.
						<span class="annotation"> [Children under marriageable age.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">74.</h3>
				<p>Males under the age of 21 whose condition is unspecified are to be tabulated as "never married," as also are males of unspecified condition, whatever their age, who stand in the relation of son, stepson, grandson, or nephew, to the head of the family, that is who reside in their father's, step-father's, grandfather's or uncle's house.
						<span class="annotation"> [Males of unspecified condition.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">75.</h3>
				<p>Females under 15 years of age whose condition is unspecified are to be tabulated as "never married," as also are females of unspecified condition, whatever their age, who stand in the relation of daughter, step-daughter, grand-daughter, or niece to the head of the family. Female domestic servants whose condition is unspecified are also assumed to have never been married.
						<span class="annotation"> [Females of unspecified condition.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">76.</h3>
				<p>Persons entered on the cards as "divorced" are to be tabulated as "never married," the fact of their being divorced being otherwise provided for.
						<span class="annotation"> [Divorced persons.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">77.</h3>
				<p>After the entries are made and the totals found to balance, the cards relating to all the lines except the lowest ("Other Occupations") must be separated from the latter, and put away as directed by the officer in charge. The remaining cards must then be sorted into the groups indicated in the line "Total Grouped," care being taken that the numbers in each group agree exactly with the sum of the numbers of the same ages in the line "Other Occupations."
						<span class="annotation"> [Final grouping of cards.] </span>
					</p>
			
		
		
			<h1 class="appendix-1-title">OCCUPATIONS.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">78.</h3>
				<p>For the classification of the Occupations the cards belonging to each group of ages must be divided into those relating to places within and outside of Melbourne and suburbs. Sheets are provided in which the occupations are arranged in alphabetical order. Each classifier will have a group assigned to him, and he must enter the numbers, together with such other particulars as are required to be extracted from the cards, in the proper columns. After this the sheets are to be cut into slips, which are to be sorted in accordance with the figures in the three left-hand columns. The numbers on the slips of each group are then to be added, and the sum is to be entered in the proper line and column of the tabulation sheet.
						<span class="annotation"> [Occupation.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="VIC-1891-census_02-15_476"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">79.</h3>
				<p>If occupations not mentioned on the lists appear on the cards, instructions must be asked as to how they are to be placed.
						<span class="annotation"> [Occupations not on lists.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">80.</h3>
				<p>Where a person returns himself as following more than one occupation, he is, as a general rule, to be tabulated under the first mentioned, but if it can be gathered from the card that he is resident where the second or third mentioned occupation is being carried on, this circumstance is to be taken as evidence of the latter being the more important, and he is to be tabulated as if following that alone. Thus if a person returns himself as "squatter and publican," or "farmer and storekeeper," and is resident at his public-house or store, he is to be tabulated as the latter, but if the two occupations appear to be carried on at the same place he is to be tabulated under the first-mentioned head.
						<span class="annotation"> [Persons with more than one occupation.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">81.</h3>
				<p>Another exception to the rule that the first-mentioned occupation is to be tabulated is in the case of persons holding offices under Government in addition to their ordinary business calling. In these cases the entry on the tabulation sheet is to be in the column showing the business, not in that of their Government appointment, although the latter may be placed first on the card.
						<span class="annotation"> [Government officials.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">82.</h3>
				<p>After the last tabulation has been completed, the following slips are to be selected and placed apart for future reference :—
						<span class="annotation"> [Ships to be placed apart.] </span>
					</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>All relating to those lines which have asterisks (*) against them in the tabulation sheet.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>All relating to entries in Order 23, Sub-orders 3 and 4.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		
		
			<h1 class="appendix-1-title">INFIRMITY.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">83.</h3>
				<p>The returns of infirmity are to be tabulated form the duplicate cards made out in accordance with the instructions contained in paragraph 49, ante.
						<span class="annotation"> [Infirmity.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">84.</h3>
				<p>Entries respecting persons suffering from more than one definite infirmity are not to be tabulated under several heads, but under the head which describes the first of the infirmities named ; thus a person stated to be "deaf and dumb and blind" should be placed in the sheet for the deaf and dumb, no notice being taken of the fact that he is also blind. If, however, the first entry should be indefinite and the second definite, as, for instance, "sick, leprosy," the latter should obviously be the one tabulated.
						<span class="annotation"> [Persons afficted with more than one infirmity.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">85.</h3>
				<p>Cards containing entries of persons affected by slight ailments, apparently not calculated to prevent them from following their usual vocations, or entries respecting the state of persons' health supposed to be made in just are to be referred to the officer in charge for instructions as to whether the information shall be made use of or rejected.
						<span class="annotation"> [Slight ailments.] </span>
					
						<span class="annotation"> [Entries made in jest.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">86.</h3>
				<p>Persons returned simply as "deaf," unless there is reason to suppose them to be also dumb are to be tabulated on a separate sheet from that appropriated to the "deaf and dumb."
