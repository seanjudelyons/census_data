		<h1 class="chapter-title">REPORT BY THE REGISTRAR - GENERAL.</h1>
		<p>TO THE HONORABLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY.</p>
		<p>SIR,</p>
		<p>In accordance with the provisions of the Act 39 Vic., No. 2, entitled "<span class="emphasis">The Quinquennial Census Act of</span>1875," a Census of the population of Queensland was taken on the night of the 1st of May, 1876 ; and I have now the honor of submitting the results, as contained in the tables 1 to 62.</p>
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
			<p>A preliminary statement, dated 24th July, containing the rough totals of population in the Census and Electoral Districts and in the Municipalities, together with the number of Chinese, Polynesians, lunatics, prisoners, and inmates of charitable institutions in the electorates, was laid before Parliament with the least possible delay after the first posting of the householders' schedules, since which the work has been carefully checked throughout, and some necessary corrections made, showing the final results of the enumeration as now given.
					<span class="annotation"> [Preliminary Statement.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
			<p>Before the passing of "<span class="emphasis">The Census Act of</span>1871 " the labors of the Registrar-General in the arrangement and superintendence of this work were much simplified by the identity of the boundaries of the Census, the Police, and the Registry Districts ; the Municipalities only being taken from their Police or Registry Districts, and formed into additional Census Districts.
					<span class="annotation"> [Police, Registry, and Census Districts formerly the same.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
			<p>By "<span class="emphasis">The Census Act of</span>1871" it was provided that the boundaries of pastoral districts and parishes should be followed in defining the Census Districts. It was pointed out by the then Registrar-General, Mr. Scott, in his Census Report of 1871, that some insuperable difficulties had presented themselves in carrying out the method of division prescribed by the Act ; but in attempting to give effect to its provisions in this particular a new arrangement of the districts was necessarily made, such as destroyed all agreement between the territorial divisions for different purposes which had previously existed.
					<span class="annotation"> [Altered by "Census Act of 1871.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
			<p>"<span class="emphasis">The Quinquennial Census Act of</span>1875" continued the provisions requiring that pastoral and parish boundaries should be followed ; and in the taking of the Census of 1876 even greater difficulties in complying with this method have presented themselves, chiefly in consequence of the extended settlement which within the last few years has taken place in the northern and western portions of the country, making it necessary to create several new districts, and materially to alter the old boundaries of the Census Districts as they were laid down in 1871.
					<span class="annotation"> [New districts and alterations in boundaries.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
			<p>In the necessary re-adjustment of the Census Districts of 1876, the rule has been adopted of making no alterations that could be avoided, retaining the boundaries of the Census Districts of 1871 wherever it was practicable, especially for purposes of comparison ; but many changes being indispensable, wherever it has been found impossible to follow pastoral and parish boundaries the principle has been acted on of making the new Census Districts.
					<span class="annotation"> [Altered Census Districts identical with Police Districts.] </span>
				</p>
		
		<div class="page-break" id="QLD-1876-census_02-03_ii"></div>
		<p>Districts identical with the Police Districts, thus making several steps in the direction of the old and convenient method of identical districts for the several purposes for which the territory is divided. The boundaries of all the Registry Districts have, at the same time, been re-adjusted and made to correspond throughout with those of the Census Districts.
				<span class="annotation"> [Registry Districts now made identical with Census Districts.] </span>
			</p>
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
			<p>After the principal division of the country into 52 districts had been determined on, communications were addressed to the Police Magistrates and others, chiefly from among the officers of the Government, to ascertain their willingness to act in the capacity of Enumerators for the management of the census work in each of these main divisions. With only one or two exceptions the somewhat onerous duties were undertaken by those whose assistance had been invited, most of whom had acted in the same capacity in the enumeration of 1871 ; and this opportunity is taken of acknowledging the carefulness and ability with which the tasks of the Enumerators were performed.
					<span class="annotation"> [Work undertaken by Enumerators.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
			<p>The<span class="emphasis">Government Gazette</span>of the 11th of February, 1876, contains the proclamation by His Excellency the Governor defining the boundaries of the districts, and appointing the Enumerators in each of them. A copy of this document, together with an alphabetical index to the districts, and an alphabetical list of the names of the Enumerators is contained in the Appendix under the letters D., E., F. The names of the Collectors in each district and sub-district will be found under the letter G.
					<span class="annotation"> [Procaclamaticn defining boundaries and appinting Enumerators.] </span>
				
					<span class="annotation"> [Index to Districts and to names of Enumerators.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
			<p>Maps of the districts having been lithographed, to be afterwards appended to this Report, loose copies were in the mean time sent to the several Enumerators with instructions for the formation of the sub-districts. In all cases where the pastoral and parish boundaries could not be followed directions were given to adopt some well defined limits, such as the natural features of the country, railway or telegraph lines, or main roads, as boundaries of the sub-divisions.
					<span class="annotation"> [Maps.] </span>
				
					<span class="annotation"> [Instructions or the formation of Sub-Districts.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
			<p>As it was intended that these lesser districts should form a permanent basis for any further partitions that might be required in the progress of settlement, great care was taken to have these instructions carried into effect. The red lines on the lithographed maps hereto appended show the sub-divisions of the Census Districts.
					<span class="annotation"> [Sub-Districts on Maps.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
			<p>With the design of making all the Registry Districts correspond with the new Census Districts, instructions were sent to the Enumerators as follows :—"The special attention of all the Enumerators is called to the necessity of observing the boundaries of the old registry districts, which in some places overlap the census districts. Wherever this is the case it is shown in the two maps herewith forwarded ; and where any one or more of the old registry districts thus impinges upon the census districts, the portion of the registry district which thus overlaps is to be in all cases made to form one or more of the first sub-divisions. The remaining sub-divisions are to be all subject to this."
					<span class="annotation"> [Overlappings of old Registry Districts forming first Sub-divisions.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
			<p>The carrying out of this instruction provided the means of showing the vital statistics in each registry district by comparison with the returns of the previous year.
					<span class="annotation"> [Means of comparison in Vital Statistics Returns.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
			<p>A description of the overlappings of the old registry districts is found in the Appendix, letter H.</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
			<p>With the assistance of the Enumerators, 287 sub-districts were thus formed, and, the collectors having been nominated by the Enumerators, these were recommended for appointment, and their employment was authorised by the Government. A list of the sub-divisions and of the names of the collectors is contained in the Appendix, letter G, with the collectors' names.
					<span class="annotation"> [Collectors appointed.] </span>
				
					<span class="annotation"> [List of names.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">15.</h3>
			<p>The rule was adopted of having one collector only for each sub-division, but as some changes in this respect became necessary in carrying out the work, the number of collectors was only 285, the number of sub-divisions being 287.</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
			<p>The remuneration of the Enumerators, subject to the approval of their work, was a fee of four guineas, and in addition thereto the following
					<span class="annotation"> [Renumeration of Enumerators.] </span>
				</p>
		
		<div class="page-break" id="QLD-1876-census_02-03_iii"></div>
		<p>payments, viz. :—Five shillings per hundred or fraction of a hundred persons enumerated up to one thousand ; three shillings per hundred or fraction of a hundred persons over a thousand and not exceeding five thousand ; and two shillings per hundred or fraction of a hundred persons over five thousand.
				<span class="annotation"> [Instructions for payment of Collectors.] </span>
			</p>
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">17.</h3>
			<p>The instructions for the payment of the collectors read as follows :—"Each Enumerator will have a distinct understanding with each of his collectors as to the rate of pay to be allowed to the latter, which will, as a general rule, and subject to the approval of their work, be on the following scale:—For men on foot, ten shillings a day ; and for mounted men finding their own horses, fifteen shillings per day. This is to be checked by the diaries of the collectors, as provided, clause 16, 'Instructions to Collectors.' Each Enumerator will have a discretionary power of agreeing for "higher rates of pay where absolutely necessary ; but before doing so, unless prevented by distance, will apply to the Registrar-General for authority on the point, and if so prevented will, as soon as possible thereafter, specially report the agreement made. In any case, it must be distinctly understood that, after agreement once made, no extra payment of any kind to any collector will be sanctioned."
					<span class="annotation"> [Discretionary power to agree for higher rates by permission.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
			<p>The rates of remuneration being the same as those previously adopted, were applicable to the more settled portions of the country, but in almost all the more distant parts to which settlement had spread so largely since the taking of the previous census, and especially in the new and gold-finding districts of the North, it was found quite impracticable to obtain collectors at anything like these rates. In several of the districts, particularly in the Cook and Palmer, much difficulty was experienced in procuring collectors for the work, and this was increased by the long drought prevailing about the time arrangements for taking the census were being made. In several cases it became necessary to consent to pay for artificial food for the horses employed ; and in most of these distant places the Enumerators were compelled to apply to the Registrar-General for authority to agree with their collectors for much higher rates than those at first named in their instructions.
					<span class="annotation"> [Difficulty of getting Collectors in the Northern Districts.] </span>
				
					<span class="annotation"> [Higher rates given.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
			<p>The lowest rates paid to collectors were ten shillings a day for footmen, and fifteen shillings for horsemen. The highest rates were paid in the Cook, Palmer, and South Kennedy Districts, where thirty-five, and in one instance forty, shillings a day had to be given.
					<span class="annotation"> [Lowest and highest.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">20.</h3>
			<p>The cost of collecting in the Cook and Palmer districts was considerably increased by the necessity of the appointment of Chinese collectors in addition to the ordinary officers.
					<span class="annotation"> [Chinese Collectors.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">21.</h3>
			<p>The district of the Palmer gold-fields was carefully mapped out by the Enumerator, Mr. Warden Selheim, seen in map No. 1, into the ordinary subdivisions, shown by the red color, in continuous lines, and again into other divisions for the Chinese collectors, as shown by the dotted lines in black.</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">22.</h3>
			<p>Including the payment of enumerators, the cost of collection per head of population averaged nearly 9½d. for the whole of the districts collectively. In some well-settled districts taken separately the cost per head of population was low, and in the district of Maryborough it averaged only 2½d. per head. The highest cost per head was in the district of Gilberton, where there were only 67 persons, and there the cost averaged £1 2s. 6d. per head of population in the district. Omitting the district of Maryborough, the average cost of the five lowest was 3¼d. ; and omitting Gilberton, which like Maryborough was exceptional, the average cost of the five highest was 8s. 5d.
					<span class="annotation"> [Cost of collection.] </span>
				</p>
		
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">23.</h3>
			<p>It will be seen that the work of enumeration in the outlying districts is very costly ; settlement having now extended itself over almost the whole of the great area of the country, and the population being very sparsely spread over a great portion of it, this scattered condition of the people must necessarily obtain for a great many years to come, and it is evident that the cost of each census-enumeration must be very considerable.
					<span class="annotation"> [Scattered condition of settlement.] </span>
				</p>
		
		<div class="page-break" id="QLD-1876-census_02-03_iv"></div>
		
			<h3 class="paragraph-title">24.</h3>
			<p>The cost of taking the census, including payment of enumerators, collectors, office work in tabulating, compiling, &amp;c. ; postages, carriage of parcels and schedules, furniture and gas fittings in offices for census purposes, including clerical aid for correcting tables now passing through the press, together with one or two amounts not yet paid, will be a little within the amount that had been voted by Parliament for this purpose, viz., £8,649 3s. 6d. The total cost per head, exclusive of printing in the Government office, has amounted to a little over 11formulad.

			<p>It may be a matter for consideration whether the advantage of numbering the population so frequently as once in five years is not too dearly paid for ; especially as the exact system of registration, and the means of ascertaining the balance of immigration over emigration, always in regular operation, have hitherto enabled us to estimate the population with a fair approach to exactness.<div class="footnote">*

				<p>It is to be regretted that means have not been devised for getting some approximate estimate, at least, of the aboriginal inhabitants ; but there are great, if not insuperable difficulties in the way, arising out of the habits and condition of the natives ; and the only plan that could be thought of for attempting a rough estimate in connection with this enumeration was considered likely to interfere too much with the ordinary work of the census collectors.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">43.</h3>
				<p>It has been pointed out in the preliminary statement that the estimated number of persons as given in the Vital Statistics of 1875 was 181,288, and that these estimates from year to year are arrived at by adding to the numbers as ascertained at each census, first 2½ per cent. to allow for omissions, and then the increase from the excess of births over deaths in each year taken from the Registers, and the increase from excess of immigration over emigration by sea.

				<p>Hitherto it had been presumed that the exchange by immigration and emigration overland between this and the neighbouring colony had been about equal, and this had been borne out by the results of each census, which made the population very nearly as it had been thus estimated. The difference shown on this occasion may have its explanation in a slight degree in the almost insuperable difficulties experienced in collecting the census on the Palmer Gold-fields, from the occurrence, just at the time arrangements were being made, of the rush to the Hodgkinson, upon which the Enumerator, Mr. Warden Selheim, thus remarks :—"Owing to the breaking out of the Hodgkinson rush, no more unfavourable time for the taking of the census could have been selected as far as my district was concerned. The whole population, European as well as Chinese, were on the move, and it has been a matter of extreme difficulty and expense to secure anything like a correct return. The difference, however, is no doubt chiefly accounted for by a balance against us during the five years since the census was taken in 1871 of immigration and emigration over the border.

				<p>To allow for a proportion certain to be overlooked in counting up so scattered a population as we have, in many parts of the colony, it has been customary to add 2½ per cent. in order to arrive at a correct estimate of the actual population. This would bring the number to 177,615, which is no doubt a very near approximation to the population of the colony.
						<span class="annotation"> [Actual population.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">46.</h3>
				<p>The population as enumerated in 1871 having been 120,104, and as taken in this census, 173,283, there is an increase of 53,179 souls, which is at the rate of 44.28 per cent in the five years. By the Census Report of the neighbouring Colony of New South Wales for 1871, the last received, it is seen that the increase in the population since 1861 in that colony had been 43.64 per cent. for the ten years.

				<p>The proportion of females to males in the Queensland Census Returns of 1876, shows a still greater inequality in the sexes than had been estimated during the last decennium. The average for ten years from 1866 to 1875, had been 66.30 females to 100 males ; the proportion as shown by the census being 65.01 to 100. A considerable increase of males as compared to females took place in the year 1875, chiefly from a larger immigration than usual of South Sea Islanders, and from a great influx of Chinese to our Northern Gold-fields.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">48.</h3>
				<p>It will be observed that the inequality of the sexes varies very much in different localities ; and, indeed, as might be expected, chiefly obtains in the pastoral and mining districts of the country. In the Census District of Brisbane, the proportion of the sexes is nearly equal. In the districts of Drayton and Toowoomba, Rockhampton, Maryborough, Warwick, and Fassifern, there is no great disproportion. In the Census District of Ipswich, the females outnumber the males. In Darling Downs, North and East, in the Leichhardt, Wide Bay and Burnett Districts, the number of males is nearly double that of the females ; while in the more remote pastoral, and in the gold mining districts, the number of females to males is very small, constituting only a fifth, a sixth, a seventh, an eighth, a tenth, a twelfth of the whole population. In the District of the Palmer, the female population forms only one 76th of the whole, the great bulk of the population being Chinese.

				<p>Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, are summary tables, showing population, inhabitants, and dwellings comparatively, in the several years in which a census has been taken. It is curious to observe, and perhaps it may be taken as indicative of a somewhat varying rate of general prosperity, that in 1864 there were 658 dwellings returned as uninhabited ; in 1868 there were 2,039 empty houses ; and in 1876 there were 862 dwellings unoccupied.

It appears likely that the collectors have omitted, in many instances, to observe what buildings were being put up in their sub-districts ; as in Brisbane alone, there must have been a larger number of houses in the course of construction than the total number returned for the entire colony.

The very unequal manner in which settlement has taken place throughout the country is further seen by an examination of Table 11, showing the area of each, and the number of persons to the square mile of each Census District in Queensland.

It is contended, however, by many residents in the Australian "bush" that the "open-house" style, with an inch or two between the rough slabs forming the wall, and with window places innocent of glass, are the most healthy of all habitations in this country ; and indeed there can be little doubt that in such a climate as we posses, persons may live almost out of doors during a great part of the year without taking much damage, and the great healthfulness of the country in the well settled districts as compared to the Australian towns is in proof that superiority of house accommodation and the possession of robust health are by no means coincident.

This shows the places where the vessels were lying, and the Census Districts to which the locality belonged. The total number of persons was 1,267 ; the number of officers and crew, 1,011 ; the number returned as passengers, 256 ; the number of sea-going vessels, 77 ; the number of river vessels 54, including 27 steamers.

				<p>In the final arrangement of the districts it was determined to adopt the three great divisions of the territory recently projected, namely, Northern, Central, and Southern ; then to retain, where practicable, the census divisions as they were in the previous enumeration of 1871, but forming some new districts in localities where a considerable increase of settlement had recently taken place. This necessitated some alteration of the adjoining districts, but in carrying out these unavoidable changes the boundaries of the Police Districts were strictly adhered to.

				<p>The approval of the Government having been obtained, all the Registry Districts were made identical with the Census Districts, and were proclaimed as thus altered in the<span class="emphasis">Government Gazette</span>of the 26th of February, 1876. The advantage of making the Registry and Census Districts alike will be very great in furnishing the means of making the registry returns so that they may be compared with the returns of population as shown in the census returns at each quinquennial period.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">78.</h3>
				<p>The Enumerators were instructed to take the portions of their new Census Districts that were overlapped by the old Registry Districts as the basis of their subdivisions, and the District Registrars were requested to keep the particulars of the vital statistics separate for these portions ; and this has proved quite successful, so that the registry returns, even for the first year, in the new order in the altered portions of the districts have been in a proper form for showing a comparison of the vital statistics of the last and previous years.

				<p>The number of persons living on Gold-fields is shown in Table 17. It will be seen that there are now 20,288 persons connected with the industry

			<p>of gold-finding, forming nearly 12 per cent. of the whole population. This is a considerable proportionate increase since the census taking of 1871, when the proportion was a little over 10 per cent.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">81.</h3>
				<p>It is questionable whether, from the peculiar circumstances before alluded to, there may not have been a considerable number of persons on the Palmer Gold-fields who have been overlooked in the enumeration. Had it been possible to get an exact return of the number in that district, our gold-digging population would thus probably have appeared more than as now shown. It is, however, very satisfactory to observe how large a number of persons are now obtaining a livelihood by this means, and over what an extent of country the precious metal has been already found deposited in considerable quantities. The Hodgkinson field, the rush to which so much interfered with our census arrangements on the Palmer, has proved to be very rich, and before the taking of the next census a very large population will, in all probability, have been settled in that locality.

				<p>It will be seen in table 18 B that several of these places are almost without inhabitants, some of them being returned as containing so few as from two to ten residents.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">86.</h3>
				<p>There is some difficulty in making a comparison in a tabular form of the population of the whole of the towns, so that it would be clearly understood, chiefly in consequence of the omission in the list of the towns in 1871 of those places connected with gold-fields, these having there been given only under the latter head.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">87.</h3>
				<p>Where settlement is rapidly increasing, and while some few places are deserted, other towns and villages rising up in many new localities, but subject to the fluctuating and disturbing element of gold-finding, it is somewhat difficult to distinguish fairly and intelligibly between what ought to be classed as rural and town population. To make the comparison as fairly and plainly as possible, it has been thought well in this Report to take such places as contain as many as a hundred inhabitants and upwards, classing these among the town population, the remainder being considered as belonging to the rural districts.

				<p>In the subjoined table the population of Municipalities proper, as returned in 1876, is shown compared with that of 1871 ; to which is added the population of all the towns containing as many as a hundred persons, including the portions of those townships connected with gold-finding, which are outside the boundaries of the proclaimed gold-fields ; with the addition also of the population outside the municipal boundaries, but within the towns or their immediate suburbs, and the shipping. The list of towns as seen in table 18 B, does not show the shipping or the population in municipal towns, nor does it include the gold-fields portion of any towns ; this being given in table 17, under the head of "Gold-fields."
						<span class="annotation"> [Towns with as many as 100 inhabitants.] </span>
					<div class="footnote">* 
						<p>In the Census Returns of 1871, the whole population of towns connected with gold-fields was included under "Gold-fields," and did not appear in the list of towns. This time an attempt has been made to separate the two in the enumeration, and the distinction as returned in the Schedules has been followed in the compilation. The last two foot-notes at page 50 are incorrectly inserted, as shown in the Errata.</p>

				<p>The number of persons thus considered as residing in towns in 1876 is 95,783, consisting of 52,226 males, and 43,557 females, being 55.27 per cent. of the whole population. The remainder, that is 77,500, constitutes what may be called the rural population, consisting of 52,783 males, and 24,717 females, forming together 44.73 per cent. of the population.

				<p>The occupation of gold-finding having now developed into large proportions, it appears necessary to separate the considerable part of the population connected with this industry. In the above simple classification of urban and rural population, all persons resident on gold-fields are included among the latter : these being deducted, the population is distributed as follows :—Total as returned, 173,283 ; urban, 95,783, or 55.27 per cent. ; pastoral and agricultural, 57,212, or 33.02 per cent. ; gold-finding, 20,288, or 11.70 per cent.
						<span class="annotation"> [Urban, pastoral and agricultural, and gold-finding population.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">92.</h3>
				<p>In the report of the last census, 1871, it is seen that the gold-fields and towns population, including the shipping, numbered 64,467, while that which would have been fairly classed as rural, numbered 55,687. Dividing the population in this way, simply into town and country, if the shipping and gold-fields are included in the former, the rural population as returned in 1871 would show a smaller number than the towns ; but by the classification now adopted, considering those occupied in gold-finding apart, the portion of the population connected with pastoral and agricultural pursuits is seen to have been in a larger proportion in 1871 than that of the towns ; the former being 55,637, the latter 52,101.
						<span class="annotation"> [Classification in 1871.] </span>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">93.</h3>
				<p>It is seen by the figures given above for 1876 that the proportion of the rural population is less now than in 1871. The population of several of our large towns has considerably increased, and Cooktown, the metropolis of the gold-producing districts in the North, has sprung into existence and become a populous place within the last five years. A decrease in the proportion of those employed as servants in pastoral occupations, from the causes presently to be noticed, has helped to alter the proportions between the town and country population ; but the diminished proportion of the rural population, as shown in the enumeration in May last, is greatly attributable to a decline in the proportion of persons engaged in agriculture, which, as will be shown under the head of Occupations, has fallen from 11.4 to 9.85 per cent. of the population. This may probably be accounted for by the fact that so few comparatively of our new arrivals now settle on the land, the bulk of them being mere laborers or mechanics, a great number of whom find regular or frequent employment in the larger towns.

				<p>The number of Chinese has increased since the taking of the last census in 1871 from 3,305 to 10,412. The explanation of the great augmentation of this class of the population is found in the attraction of the Palmer Gold-fields, its proximity to the "flowery land," and the convenience of the Torres Straits line of steamers.

				<p>The changes which have been made from time to time in the boundaries of the Census Districts, render it difficult to give an exact return of the increase and decrease of population in each in a tabular form ; and as far as some of the separate districts are concerned, to do so has, in fact, become an impossibility. This is given as nearly as it is now practicable in table 22, which shows increase or decrease numerically by persons in the districts in periods from 1861 to 1864, from 1864 to 1868, from 1868 to 1871, and from 1871 to 1876 ; these being the years in which the census enumerations

				<p>The impossibility of showing perfectly the increase in each separate district from the changes in the boundaries, has partly suggested the arrangement of districts in groups, as seen in table 24. In the Northern group, commencing with Somerset, and including the more settled country on the coast as far as Mackay, the population has very largely increased during the last five years, the centesimal increase amounting to 171.52. The North-central group, still keeping to districts near the coast line, shows an increase of 25.65. The South-central, in the same manner, shows 34.17. The West Moreton group, including Stanley, West Moreton, Ipswich, and Fassifern, shows an increase of 15.58. East Moreton, including Caboolture, Brisbane, East Moreton, Oxley, and Logan, show an increase of 43.25. The great western pastoral districts, including the whole of the far west through the length of the country from Burke to Cunnamulla, have largely added to their population in the same period, the centesimal increase in this group being 97.78.

No doubt the system of fencing in the runs, now so general, enabling sheep-owners to do with much fewer hands in the management of their large establishments, has chiefly to do with the decrease in the number of persons employed as servants in pastoral pursuits.

It might have been desirable to have had this class divided, showing it under several separate orders, but the method previously in use has been again adopted as provided for under schedule A, of "<span class="emphasis">The Quinquennial Census Act.</span>" This class is also divided into employers and employed. This distinction is perhaps less obvious among the agricultural class than in any other of the occupations, a number of the small proprietary farmers doing their own work except during the harvest season, when neighbours assist each other. Such persons are not properly speaking "employers," and they are not in any sense servants. Those classed as "employers" as returned under this head number 10,535, the employed numbering only 6,534.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">132.</h3>
				<p>The total number returned as "agricultural" is 17,069, this being 9.85 per cent. of the whole population ; a decrease in the proportion since 1871, when they were 11.4 of the whole.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">133.</h3>
				<p>The proportion per cent. in the two classes, pastoral and agricultural, to the whole population in the years 1871 and 1876, will be clearly seen as follows:—

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">134.</h3>
				<p>It will be seen that under the class "pastoral" the employers returned in 1876 are in the proportion of about 2 to 8½ employed, but in the agricultural class the employers as returned far outnumber the employed, being in the proportion of 10 of the former to 6 of the latter ; so that many returned as employers are not really so, but are proprietors of land doing the work of their farms themselves, or with the assistance of members of their own families, without paying for hired labor.

				<p>is very numerous. It comprehends workers and dealers in art and mechanical, animal, and vegetable productions, and in minerals.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">138.</h3>
				<p>Great interest and importance attaches to this class of occupations from the numbers thus already finding employment, and from the prospects of increasing wealth derivable from the mineral resources of the country. Already the yield of gold exceeds in value that which had been long almost the only important staple of the country ; the exports of wool during the years 1874 and 1875 having been less in value than that of the precious metal.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">140.</h3>
				<p>Tin mining appears now for the first time among the industries of the country, the extensive tin deposits in the district now appropriately named Stanthorpe having been discovered since the census enumerations of 1871.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">141.</h3>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">142.</h3>
				<p>The number engaged as tin miners, all returned as males, is 799. There are 396 persons employed in obtaining Copper, all but one returned as males. Coal mining employs 194 persons, all males. Some of the coal obtained is of a superior quality. Probably this may be procured before long in much larger quantities.
						<span class="annotation"> [Coal.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">143.</h3>
				<p>Gold mining, including alluvial, employs 12,541 persons, three only being returned as females. The numbers resident on the gold-fields, seen in table 17 to be 20,288, includes women and children, returned under the heads of "domestic duties" and "personal offices," as well as a great many persons resident on gold-fields, and more or less dependent on this branch of industry, but not themselves engaged in digging or reefing.

						<span class="annotation"> [Others.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">146.</h3>
				<p>The total number under the class here termed "Industrial" is 28,177, of whom 1,735 are females, and 26,442 are males, the whole constituting 16.26 per cent. of the entire population.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">147. CLASS X. LABORERS.—</h3>
				<p>Under this head are included, as hitherto, all such laborers as mechanics, manufacturers, shopmen and women, apprentices, contractors, managers and foremen, whose particular branch is not defined in the returns.

					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">148.</h3>
				<p>This classification indicates a wide range from unskilled laborers upwards. Possibly the more severe descriptions of labor might with stricter propriety be thus classed, but, in fact, no apology is necessary for placing any class in such a category, as in this country, happily, the term laborer might include almost every resident exclusive of those who are too young or too old for work.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">149.</h3>
				<p>Of this class the number returned is 5,123, of whom there are 5,107 males and only 16 females.</p>

					<p>Prisoners in gaols, penal establishments, reformatories, lock-ups, and those in charge of the police.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">151.</h3>
				<p>It is gratifying to see that though the population has increased by upwards of 53,000 persons, the number of paupers shows an actual decrease. In the census of 1871 it was returned as 744, in that of 1876 as 569, decrease 175.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">160.</h3>
				<p>This is not an uninteresting or unimportant part of the subject under consideration. The proportion of persons of all ages and both sexes already married, the number and proportion of the unmarried, and the number who are widowed as well as the few whose condition was not stated, are shown in tables 29 to 40.

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">162.</h3>
				<p>It will be seen that the number of unmarried persons in 1876 is 114,611 ; the married numbering 53,237. The proportion of married is very nearly the same as in the census enumerations of 1871, the centesimal rate being 30.73 in 1876, and 30.77 in 1871.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">163.</h3>
				<p>The proportion of unmarried very nearly approximates in the two periods, the centesimal rate of unmarried to the whole population being 66.13 in 1876, and 65.74 in the former period of 1871.
						<span class="annotation"> [Unmarried.] </span>
					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">164.</h3>
				<p>The increased number of Chinese and Polynesians now in the Colony will be more than enough to account for this disadvantage in the latter as compared to the former period, this class having numbered 5,641 in 1871 are found to be nearly trebled in 1876, numbering 15,520, of whom 183 only are females.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">165.</h3>
				<p>Among the unmarried the proportion of males is greatly in excess ; the males being 73,249, the females 41,362, showing an excess of males of 31,887.

					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">166.</h3>
				<p>The disproportion of the sexes obtains chiefly in the adult population. Summary table 31 shows that at 15 years of age the males and females are nearly equal ; from 15 to 20 there is a considerable disproportion, approaching to half as many more males than females ; from 20 to 21 there are about two and a half times, and from 21 to 25 nearly four times as many males as females ; and this disproportion continues to increase until at the period of age from 40 to 45, the number of single males is thirty times that of the single females, which is the highest difference shown.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">167.</h3>
				<p>Of the married persons 28,520 are returned as males, and 24,717 only as females, giving 3,803 husbands more than wives, and, of course, showing that there are this number of married men in the Colony without their wives. To a certain extent a difference of this kind might be expected in a country where the population is rapidly increasing from immigration, with, no doubt, a considerable number of men coming out as pioneers to make a home for their families.

				<p>AGES AT MARRIAGE are seen in the same table 31. It shows that early marriages are chiefly among the females, and those under 15 years exclusively so ; fifteen females only being returned as married under that age. The disproportion continues great up to 21 years, and then diminishes, until at the period from 30 to 35, the number of males preponderates, and at the more advanced age periods is considerably in excess.

				<p>It is seen from the above table, showing centesimal rates from the returns made which are doubtless approximately correct, that the largest proportionate increase since a census was first taken in Queensland has been of the Hebrew Church, but the aggregate numbers of this church are too small to be of much value in showing increase centesimally. The next in the rate per cent. of increase are Wesleyans in their two sections as returned, then Roman Catholics, then Presbyterians ; after these Congregationalists or Independents ; following these members of the Church of England.

					</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">214.</h3>
				<p>The members of the Baptist and Lutheran Churches appear to have made no return until 1868 ; a comparison can therefore only be made from that period, and it appears probable that their numbers are not even now fully returned. It is observable that although the figures under "other denominations" (see foot-note, table 57) are lower than in 1861, showing a decrease of 29.12, yet that under the head "religion not stated," the increase is much larger than that connected with any of the denominations, from which it may be fairly presumed that an increasing proportion of persons are indisposed to make any return under the head of religion. It should, however, be observed that the whole number thus practically objecting in the census of 1876 are only 3.43 per cent. of the whole population.

Persons on the Gold Fields to state distinctly, after their present occupation, their former calling, as "Gold Miner—formerly Physician ;" "Storekeeper—formerly Carpenter" When a Gold Miner employs others to assist him, he should return himself "Gold Miner— employing—men." A miner working for another should return himself as a "Gold Miner," not as a laborer.</p>
			<p>ARTIRAKS AND MECHANICS should always mention whether they are Masters or Journeymen, whether they keep a shop, store, &amp;c., and the number of persons in their employment. The materials on which Mechanics work, and the particular branch of their trade, are always to be distinctly expressed ; thus, "Ship Carpenter," "House Carpenter," "Shingler," "Coschsmith," "Locksmith," "Horse-shoer."</p>
			<p>A person engaged in more than one pursuit should state his occupation in the order of their importance to himself.</p>
			<p>CARTERS, CARRIERS, LABORERS, SERVANTS, &amp;c., to describe themselves by the name of their usual employment, as "Drayman on Wharf," "Carter to the Diggings," "Laborer making Roads," "Omnibus Driver," "Cabman," "Porter," "Messenger," &amp;c.</p>
			<p>Persons not following any Profession, Trade, or Calling, and not holding any public Office, but possessed of independent means, may designate themselves "Proprietor of Land," "Proprietor of Houses," "Annuitant," as the case may be. The word "Householder" should not be used in place of "Proprietor of Houses," nor the word "Gentleman" or "Lady" in place or "No occupation." Persons who have ceased to follow one pursuit, and have not commenced another, should enter " No occupation at present."</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">WOMEN.—</h3>
				<p>The occupations of women not coming under the foregoing instructions, and who are employed in any but domestic duties, should be distinctly recorded.

When only in the relation of Son, Daughter, or other relative, write "Domestic Duties," as in the case of women.</p>
			
			<p>PERSONS IN HOSPITALS, ASYLUMS, GAOLS, &amp;c.—Care should be taken to describe their position as inmates, in addition to the insertion of their previous occupation, thus ; "Prisoner," " Patient," " Gaoler," "Nurse."</p>
			<p>The occupation which each person is actually following and deriving income from at the time of the Census should in all cases be stated.,</p>

		<h1 class="appendix-title">APPENDIX B.</h1>
		
			<h1 class="appendix-1-title">INSTRUCTIONS TO ENUMERATORS.—(CORRECTED COPY.)</h1>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Issued by the Registrar-General under the Provisions of the 7th Clause of "The Quinquennial Census Act of</span>1875."</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
				<p>Every Enumerator shall on his first appointment make and subscribe a declaration in form B, which he will forward to the Registrar-General at the same time as he forwards the householders' schedules and other papers as regulated by clause 11 of the Act.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>Every Enumerator will be furnished with a copy of the Act, and a map in duplicate of the district for which he has been appointed. One of the maps he will, as speedily as possible, return to the Registrar-General, with sub-divisions marked as directed below, paragraphs 5, 6, and 7.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>The Enumerator must thoroughly acquaint himself with the extent, boundaries, and natural features of his district, and will then proceed to divide it into sub-districts.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>In order to divide his district in the most convenient manner, the Enumerator must bear in mind that the population of pastoral districts, parishes, municipalities, and townships is hereafter to be separately obtained from the collectors' returns, and that therefore it is of the utmost consequence that collectors' sub-districts should be constructed so as to correspond as far as possible with the boundaries of such divisions. As a guide to the Enumerator, it may be stated that he had better first turn his attention to municipalities and townships in his district, and taking any municipality or township which has an area and population not too large for one able-bodied and active man to visit and enumerate within the compass of one day, and make it into one collector's sub-district. Should it, however, be too large for one man to undertake, the Enumerator must divide it into two or as many collectors' sub-districts as necessary, taking some well-defined line, such as a river, road, or street, as a boundary. He will then turn his attention to the country portion of his district, and divide it into collectors' sub-districts, going as far as he can by parish boundaries, and having regard to the area, population, and natural features of the country, so that the collection of the householders' schedules from each sub-district may be a fair day's work for one man. The lines of boundary are supposed to run down the middle of the river, road, or street, as the case may be ; so that the houses, farms, &amp;c., on one side will be in one sub-district, and those on the other side in another sub-district.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>Enumerators who acted in taking the Census of 1871 are advised that changes have been made in the Census divisions of the colony, new districts having been formed, and the boundaries of others altered. The Registry-districts are now made identical with the Census-districts. The new and altered Census-districts are as follows :—Somerset, Cook, Palmer, Etheridge, Gilberton, Burke, Marathon, Blackall, Tambo, Cunnamulla, Warrego, Charleville, Eastern Downs, Stanthorpe, Gladstone, Wide Bay, Maryborough, Tiaro, Gympie, and Bundaberg. All the other districts have their outside boundaries as before.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
				<p>The special attention of all the Enumerators is called to the necessity of observing the boundaries of the old Registry-districts, which in some places overlap the Census-districts. Wherever this is the case, it is shown in the two maps herewith forwarded ; and where any one or more of the old Registry-districts thus impinges upon the Census-districts, the portion of the Registry-district which thus overlaps is to be in all cases made to form one or more of the first sub-divisions. The remaining sub-divisions are to be all subject to this. This will necessitate a change in the sub-division of most of the Census-districts ; but in any case where there may be no Registry-district line crossing the Census-district, and where no change has been otherwise made, the old sub-divisions as shown on the maps will probably in most cases be again suitable.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>The Enumerator having arranged his plan for sub-dividing his district and carefully marked it in pencil on the duplicate copy of the map sent to him, will forward the same, with the least possible delay, to the Registrar-General for approval, stating at the same time the number of householders' schedules that he will require.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
				<p>The Enumerator shall then, on approval of his plan of sub-division (or without it, in cases where distance may have absolutely prevented its submission), and subject to the approval of the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council, appoint a collector to each sub-district (<span class="emphasis">vide</span>4th and 5th clauses of "<span class="emphasis">Census Act</span>"), to whom he will clearly describe the boundaries of his sub-division and assign a distinguishing number, beginning with number 1.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
				<p>No Enumerator will be allowed to act as a collector.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
				<p>Enumerators will bear in mind that the qualifications required in a collector are intelligence and activity, thorough ability to read and write well, a fair knowledge of arithmetic, and above all, sobriety.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
				<p>On the approval of the collector by the Governor in Council (or without such formal approval if not received in time), the Enumerator must get him to sign form B, and impress upon him the great importance of the duties he has undertaken, and how much depends on his own individual intelligence and exertion. He must explain to him how absolutely necessary it is that he should return every soul living in his sub-district on the night between the 1st and 2nd of May, with the single exception of the native blacks aboriginal of Australia ; and that, should he find himself placed in a position where he wants information, or has a complaint to make, he must in all cases apply to the Enumerator, who, should the matter be beyond his powers, can then refer the same to the Registrar-General.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
				<p>Every Enumerator will receive from the Registrar-General all the forms and declarations necessary for taking the Census in his district ; but should any Enumerator be in doubt as to any part of his own or his collectors' duties, or should he not thoroughly understand the various forms or the method of filling them up, or should he run short of forms, he must communicate with the Registrar-General without loss of time, and wherever a saving of time is of importance he may freely use the electric telegraph, O.H.M.S., either alone or in conjunction with the Post Office.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
				<p>The Census is to be taken on the night of Monday, the 1st May, 1876, and the Enumerators are enjoined to take the preliminary steps above pointed out as long beforehand as possible. Between the 21st April and 1st May, the 8th clause of the Act requires Enumerators to cause to be left at every dwelling within their district one householder's schedule. This duty is to be performed by the collectors, and it is therefore necessary, that the Enumerator should, before the 21st of April, give to each collector a sufficient number of householders' schedules, with some to spare, together with a blank form C and form for making out return for schedules so given to him. The Enumerator will also furnish the collector with one of the cases that will be supplied by the Registrar-General for holding papers.</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="QLD-1876-census_02-05_165"></div>
			<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO ENUMERATORS—continued.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
				<p>In the early part of May the Enumerator should be in receipt of all the householders' schedules, return of empty houses, declarations in form C, and return of schedules distributed by him, properly filled up, signed and docketed by the collector. It will then be his duty, keeping all the documents received from each collector separates by themselves and with the proper distinguishing number affixed to each paper or sheet, to examine the said documents carefully, satisfy himself that the collectors have faithfully performed the duties required of them by the "Census Act," and cause any defect or inaccuracy to be made good as far as possible. Having done this, he will, within fourteen days of the receipt as above of the householders' schedules, make out the collective return required by the 11th clause of the Act, and transmit it, together with the householders' schedules, returns of empty houses, collectors' declarations in form C, returns by collectors of schedules, the two declarations from himself on forms B and D, the map of his district, and all unused forms of whatever nature, to the Registrar-General at Brisbane.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">15.</h3>
				<p>The Enumerator will, at the same time, forward to the Registrar-General the declaration made by each collector in form B, endorsing on it the number of days on which the collector was at work for the Census, and whether he used a horse, the amount of work performed, and the facilities afforded by roads, rivers, or railways for its completion, together with a report of any extraordinary circumstances by which the collector may have been affected whilst doing his duty. And to this declaration the Enumerator must carefully attach the diary kept by the collector, which must be given up to him for that purpose.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
				<p>The remuneration of Enumerators will, subject to the approval of their work, be as follows, viz. :—A fee of four guiness, and in addition thereto the following payments, viz. :—5s. per hundred or fraction of a hundred persons enumerated up to 1,000 ; 3s. per hundred or fraction of a hundred persons over 1,000 and not exceeding 5,000 ; and 2s. per hundred or fraction of a hundred persons over 5,000.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">17.</h3>
				<p>Each Enumerator will have a distinct understanding with each of his collectors as to the rate of pay to be allowed to the latter, which will, as a general rule, and subject to approval of their work, be on the following scale :—For men on foot, 10s. per day ; and for mounted men, finding their own horses, 15s. per day. This to be checked by the diary of collectors, as provided clause 16 "Instructions to Collectors." Each Enumerator will have a discretionary power of agreeing for higher rates of pay where absolutely necessary ; but before doing so, unless prevented by distance, will apply to the Registrar-General for authority on the point, and if so prevented, will as soon as possible thereafter specially report the agreement made. In any case it must be distinctly understood that, after agreement once made, no extra payment of any kind to any collector will be sanctioned.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
				<p>The Enumerator must see that the collectors make out their vouchers properly, and must then certify to the work having been done ; they must also make out their own vouchers separately, specifying the amounts of money they may have been out of pocket for postages, parcels, &amp;c., &amp;c., and forward both to the Registrar-General at same time as other Census documents. On all the various documents and papers being examined, and the amounts of the vouchers found correct, the Registrar-General will pay over to the Enumerators the amount due to them and to the collectors.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
				<p>Enumerators must carefully observe that information obtained by them for the Census is on no account to be made public until submitted in due form to the Government. (<span class="emphasis">Vide clause</span>18, "<span class="emphasis">Quinquennial Census Act,</span>1875.")</p>

		<h1 class="appendix-title">APPENDIX C.</h1>
		
			<h1 class="appendix-1-title">INSTRUCTIONS TO COLLECTORS.</h1>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Issued by the Registrar-General under the Provisions of the 7th Clause of "The Quinquennial Census Act of 1875."</span></p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">1.</h3>
				<p>Every Collector shall, immediately on his appointment, make and subscribe a declaration in form B presented to him for that purpose by the Enumerator.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>The eighth clause of "The Census Act" directs that, within ten days next preceding the 1st of May, 1876, each Enumerator shall cause to be left at every dwelling within his district one Householder's Schedule. This duty is to be performed by the Collectors. If the number of inhabitants in one house requires it, two or more Schedules may be left ; and if the house be inhabited by two or more occupiers, a Schedule is to be left with each ; understanding by "occupier" either the resident owner, or any person who pays rent, whether as a tenant for the whole house, or as a lodger for any distinct floor, apartment, or portion. By the first clause of the Act, a dwelling is declared to mean "any house, building, booth, tent, hut, or other erection in or under which any person usually sleeps, and every ship or other vessel in any port or harbor of the Colony."</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>To enable a Collector to perform this important duty with accuracy, he must omit no opportunity of thoroughly acquainting himself with his subdivision, the boundaries that have been assigned to it, its roads and natural features, with the probable number of dwellings it may contain. He will take care to receive from the Enumerator a sufficient number of Householder's Schedules, and some to spare, and he will leave one at each dwelling, or with each occupier, between the 21st April and 1st May.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>On leaving the Schedule, the Collector must explain to the person receiving it the nature and importance of the document the obligation imposed upon the occupier to give a complete and accurate statement of the several particulars required, and the penalty incurred by non-compliance (vide Clause 14 of the Act). He should also state that he will call for it on the 2nd of May, or as early as possible thereafter, and that it must on no account be lost or destroyed.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>The Collector must also represent to the masters or resident owners of all hotels, inns, public-houses, lodging-houses, or the like, that they are required to give a return of the numbers, and sexes, and the other particulars in the Schedule respecting every person who sleeps or remains in their houses on the night of the 1st of May.</p>
			
		
		
			<h1 class="appendix-1-title">DUTIES OF COLLECTORS ON AND AFTER THE 2ND MAY, 1876.</h1>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
				<p>As early as possible on the morning of Tuesday, the 2nd May, 1876, each Collector shall commence his labors. He must provide himself with a pencil, pen, and ink, blotting-paper, a packet of pins, taking with him the case for holding papers with which he will have been furnished by the Enumerator. He must then proceed to visit every house in his subdivision. If this comprises more than one pastoral district or parish he must finish one before beginning the other, taking care to keep the Schedules received from each distinct. It is the Collector's duty to ascertain if there be more than one occupier in each house, and if so, to obtain a separate return from each. If the Schedule be given to him filled up, he must read it through and carefully ascertain if all the particulars are correctly and degibly entered. To satisfy himself on this point, he should ask all necessary questions of the occupier, if he is present ; if not, of any other person in the house. Should he discover any mistake, he must draw his pen or pencil through the erroneous words without erasing them, and enter the correct words in their place, initialing the corrections so made.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>Having satisfied himself that the Schedule is properly filled up, he must endorse upon the back of it the distinguishing number of his subdivision, the name of the pastoral district, parish, town or village, ward, street or road, name or number of the dwelling, and the name of the Census district ; and, lastly, he must number each Schedule as he receives it, beginning with number 1.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
				<p>If on asking for the Schedule he should find that it is not filled up by the occupier, the Collector must fill it up, asking all necessary questions from the head of the family if possible, or, in the event of the occupier's absence, from any other member of the family capable of affording the required information, getting such informant to sign the Schedule and countersigning it himself.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
				<p>If the Schedule is lost or mislaid, the Collector must supply a fresh one from the spare ones given to him by the Enumerator, and proceed as before directed, marking on such Schedule the fate of the previous one, and writing " Substituted Form" on the Schedule. When he has completed his entries he should read them over to the informant, and get him to sign it at foot.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
				<p>Care must be taken that no person sleeping in the house on the night of 1st May is omitted from the Schedule, but no one who was absent that night is to be inserted. Persons who are at work on the night of the 1st May, but who will be at home on Tuesday, the 2nd May, must be entered by the Collector in the Schedule of the house in which they reside ; and persons traveling on the night of the 1st May must be returned at the hotel or house at which they stop or take up their residence on the morning of the 2nd May. The Collector must do his best to enumerate any individual or party who may have camped out in his sub-district on the night of the 1st May.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
				<p>If any person refuse to answer the questions which the Collector is authorised to put, the Collector shall remind such person of the penalty that will be incurred under fourteenth clause of "The Census Act" for such refusal ; and if such person persist in refusing, the Collector shall take a note of the name and residence of such person, and report the refusal to the Enumerator as soon as possible.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
				<p>The Collector must not omit to enter persons in any Schedule because he cannot get all the information required respecting them. If, for example, he can learn no more than that a person had slept in a house on the night of the 1st May, who had since gone away, and whose name was unknown, he must set down such person in the Schedule, writing " Not known" or "N.K." where the name should be, and stating the sex and age, as near as possible.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
				<p>If there be more than one occupier in a house, the Collector must pin together the Schedules received from that house ; but if a house be uninhabited or in course of building, the Collector must make a note of it at the foot of the Householder's Schedule last received or used by him, stating the description of such house. By an "uninhabited" house, he must understand a house in which no person abode on the night of the 1st May.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
				<p>No communication of any sort is to be sent by any Collector to the Registrar-General. All communications or complaints he may have to make must be sent to the Enumerator for the district.</p>

			<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO COLLECTORS—continued.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">15.</h3>
				<p>Chinamen, Malays, Polynesians, and all other foreigners of whatever nation or color, are to be counted ; but the native blacks (aboriginals of Australia) are not to be included.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
				<p>The Collector must keep a diary showing each day's distance traveled and all work done, which he will hand over to the Enumerator on the completion of his work.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">17.</h3>
				<p>The Collector having collected all the schedules in his subdivision on Tuesday, the 2nd May, on as soon thereafter as practicable, shall within seven days, if possible on or before the 9th of May, deliver them to his Enumerator, together with a declaration made and subscribed by himself in form C. He must arrange and tie up in order the Schedules according to their numbers, and be careful to affix to every document he delivers to his Enumerator the distinguishing number of his subdivision.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
				<p>The Collector will then make out and sign vouchers for his pay, and hand the same to the Enumerator for the purpose of being forwarded to the Registrar-General, the amount of which, if found correct, will be forwarded at once by the Registrar-General to the Enumerator on behalf of the Collector. Vouchers coming to the Registrar-General in any other way will be returned as irregular.</p>

				<p>"Every collector shall within ten days next preceding the day fixed for taking the census as aforesaid cause to be left at every dwelling within his sub-district one of such forms.
