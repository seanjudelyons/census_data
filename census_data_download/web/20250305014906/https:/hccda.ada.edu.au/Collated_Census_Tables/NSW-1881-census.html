			<h1 class="section-title">REPORT.</h1>
			<p>The REGISTRAR-GENERAL to the Honorable THE COLONIAL SECRETARY, transmitting Returns and Conspectus Tables relating to the Census of 1881, and reporting upon the results obtained therefrom.</p>
			<p>Registrar-General's Office, Sydney, 1 August, 1883.</p>
			<p>Sir,</p>
			<p>In presenting my Report upon the statistical results obtained from the Census of 1881, it is with extreme regret that I have to state that the efforts of the Compiler have been disastrously impeded by the calamitous fire which occurred at the Garden Palace, on the morning of Friday, the 22nd of September, 1882.
					<span class="annotation"> [Fire at the Garden Palace.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>By that fire the arduous work of many months was irretrievably lost to the Government and to the public.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, certain returns had been given into the hands of the Government Printer, by which the principal results of the Census were preserved ; but the offices of the Compiler and his staff being located in the basement of the Garden Palace, the whole of the details, which would have been of the most interesting character, were consumed, and there are no means by which they could be reproduced short of taking a new Census.
					<span class="annotation"> [Certain returns preserved.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Since the calamity referred to, the Compiler, under almost overwhelming disadvantages, has been employed in the reproduction of some of the work which was destroyed. The only materials for such reproduction, at his command, were the returns which had been presented to Parliament, and a few fragmentary papers in his possession. When the fire took place, a large number of conspectus tables were ready for the lithographer, and it was in the reproduction of these tables that the Compiler experienced the greatest amount of difficulty. They were of a novel character, and were intended to show in a diagramatic form the results obtained by the Census. Fortunately most of them have been successfully reproduced ; they show at a glance that which could otherwise only be obtained by the study of a vast amount of figures, and I confidently submit them to the Government as a valuable addition to the otherwise meagre results—meagre by reason of the destruction of the labours of thirty persons who had been employed on the tabulation of the Census papers.
					<span class="annotation"> [Reproduction of work.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Although so much valuable work was destroyed, by which all the detailed information is lost to the public, it is with no small feeling of satisfaction that I am able to state that the main results are more fully given for the Census of 1881 than were given for any previous Census, and that these results are very accurate.
					<span class="annotation"> [Fullness and accuracy of results.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The Census of New South Wales was taken under powers given by Act of Parliament, 44 Victoria, No.2 (Appendix A), which provided for the obtaining of the necessary information referring to the population of the Colony, and also certain Agricultural and Pastoral Statistics ; to these two latter subjects, however, no reference will be made in this Report, as they have been already dealt with separately in the Statistical Register for the year 1881.
					<span class="annotation"> [Preliminary remarks. [formula]] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_ii"></div>
			<p>I would here respectfully suggest that, as the information relative to the agricultural and pastoral statistics is collected every year by the police, it would be judicious on future occasions to omit from any Census Act all matters not purely connected with the population of the country, inasmuch as it takes the work out of the hands of those persons most accustomed to the duty, while it tends most seriously to embarrass the Census collectors in the proper performance of the very important work for which they are appointed.
					<span class="annotation"> [Pastoral and agricultural returns.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The day named by the Imperial Government for taking the Census was the 3rd April, 1881, and that date was adopted throughout nearly the whole of the British Empire. The 3rd of April was Sunday, and it was that night—between Sunday and Monday—that was fixed as being the most likely time to find the people at home.
					<span class="annotation"> [Date of taking the Census.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The scattered nature of the population, and the very large extent of territory, rendered it impracticable to follow the example of England in distributing and collecting the schedules in one day. The Colony was therefore divided into the most convenient districts to enable the work to be performed in the shortest possible time, having due regard to completeness and accuracy, in accordance with the 6th clause of the Act, which provides that the schedules should be delivered at every dwelling throughout the Colony in the course of the week ending on Saturday the 2nd of April, and collected on the following Monday, or as shortly thereafter as possible.
					<span class="annotation"> [Division into Districts.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The Colony was divided for Census purposes into seventy-two Census Districts, corresponding with the Electoral Districts, the boundaries of which were fixed in accordance with the Electoral Act, 44 Victoria No. 13. Some of these districts, however, were considered too large for the supervision of one enumerator, and they were again subdivided, making altogether ninety-six districts and sub-districts (Appendix K).
					<span class="annotation"> [Division into Districts.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>A circular, No. 1 (Appendix D) was forwarded to certain persons, principally Police Magistrates, Clerks of Petty Sessions, and District Registrars, in every district and sub-district, to ascertain their willingness and ability to undertake the duties of enumerator ; and in the event of non-acceptance by any of them, a second circular, No. 2 (Appendix E) was forwarded to the Bench of Magistrates at such places, requesting that they would furnish the names of eligible persons willing and competent to perform such duties. The enumerators when finally appointed comprised Police Magistrates, Clerks of Petty Sessions, District Registrars, and in some cases gentlemen unconnected with Government Service, recommended by the local Bench of Magistrates.
					<span class="annotation"> [Preparatory work.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>When the appointment of the enumerators had been confirmed by the Government, a circular of preliminary instructions, No. 3 (Appendix F) was forwarded to each of them, with maps in duplicate of their various districts. These maps were prepared entirely by the Compiler, from the descriptive boundaries furnished by the Surveyor-General. They showed as clearly as possible the natural boundaries of each district, and the divisions that were required. The enumerators were also furnished with a form divided into columns, which they were requested to fill up and return to the Compiler with the necessary information as to the number of collectors they would require, the amount of days it was estimated they would be employed, and whether they would be employed on foot or on horseback, the estimated number of dwellings in each district or sub-district, the number of schedules that each collector would require, and specifying what portion of the district they proposed to allot to each collector.
					<span class="annotation"> [Appointment of enumerators and preliminary instructions.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The result of these returns was that 810 collectors were appointed for the whole Colony, including sixty for Sydney. Of this number, 609 were employed on horseback, 147 on foot, forty-five partly on horseback and partly on foot, and nine in boats, for the collection of the information relating to persons who on the night of the 3rd of April were located on board ships, in boats, barges, &amp;c., in any of the ports, harbours, &amp;c., of the Colony.
					<span class="annotation"> [Appointment of collectors.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>After the appointment of the collectors had been confirmed by the Government, a further circular of detailed instructions, No. 4 (Appendix G) was forwarded to each enumerator, in which the greatest care was taken to ensure accuracy, by minutely setting forth what steps should be adopted towards that end. Particular attention was directed to the collection of the Census of the Chinese population, by authorizing the appointment of Chinese interpreters ; and in order that there should
					<span class="annotation"> [Additional instructions to enumerators.] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_iii"></div>
			<p>be no omissions, the enumerators were directed to call the attention of their collectors to the absolute necessity of vigilance in finding out the travellers in their respective districts, by visiting the various camping grounds and roads on the night of Sunday and early on the morning of Monday the 3rd and 4th of April. I have every reason to believe that this duty was faithfully performed, and that very few (if any) persons who were houseless, homeless, or travelling, were omitted from the Census. Roving Aborigines were not included under the denomination of houseless persons or travellers, but a separate account was taken of these individuals, and an approximate estimate of the numbers and sexes of the wild tribes was directed to be given in each district.
					<span class="annotation"> [Additional instructions to enumerators.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The remuneration to be paid to enumerators was fixed at from £15 to £25 for each district or sub-district ; but, considering the amount of work they had to perform, only four of them received the minimum amount, the others receiving £20 or £25 according to the size and importance of the district and its population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Remuneration to enumerators and collectors.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The collectors' pay was fixed at the rate of 10 shillings per diem on foot and 20 shillings per diem on horseback or in boats ; but in some few instances in the interior, where the drought had been very severe and protracted, the pay on horseback was increased to 25 shillings per diem, to meet the additional cost of horse-feed. In some cases where Government officials were employed as collectors the rates were reduced. Chinese interpreters were paid at the same rate as collectors.</p>
			<p>The enumerators were held responsible for the proper performance of the duties of the collectors under their orders, and all instructions to the collectors were issued by the enumerators, who also supplied them with a tracing and written description of the district through which each of them had to travel.
					<span class="annotation"> [Responsibility of enumerators.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In order that the enumerators should be assisted in the very important work which they had undertaken, a circular, No. 6 (Appendix I) was forwarded to all the Benches of Magistrates and all the prominent Members of the Government Service throughout the Colony, asking their assistance and advice to the enumerators and collectors employed on the Census, and the Inspector-General of Police also instructed the officers of his department to afford every assistance in their power. Thus, in the collection of the Census, a general interest in the success of the undertaking was awakened in all parts of the Colony, and with a few exceptions the greatest anxiety was evinced by the persons employed to make the work as perfect as possible.
					<span class="annotation"> [Assistance to enumerators and collectors.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>There were however some exceptions to the rule, in which certain individuals seemed to look upon the taking of the Census as a good opportunity for fleecing the Government and the country in the most shameless manner. The most exorbitant claims were sent in for the work performed, and it was only by the determined stand taken by the Compiler in the examination of such claims that the country was protected from considerable extortion. The settlement of these claims was a source of considerable worry and anxiety to both the Compiler and myself.
					<span class="annotation"> [Excessive claims for duties performed.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>There were two forms used for the purpose of obtaining the necessary information—the "Household Schedule" (Appendix B) and the "Ship return" (Appendix C) ; the latter only differing but slightly from the former, and intended for the occupiers of ships, steamers, barges, &amp;c.
					<span class="annotation"> [Forms for distribution.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>About 250000 of these schedules and forms were sent out to the enumerators, in accordance with their estimate of the number required, out of which over 160000 were filled up and returned to the Compiler.
					<span class="annotation"> [Number of schedules used.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The information sought to be obtained from every head of a family consisted of the name and surname of every member of his or her household, their relation to him or her, whether married, unmarried, or widowed, their sex, age, rank, profession or occupation, nationality, the religion they followed, their degree of education, and also a description of the dwelling in which they resided.
					<span class="annotation"> [Information required.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The word "household" or "dwelling" was taken to include all buildings, tenements, tents, or other erections of which the whole or any part was used for the purpose of habitation ; each of these, without reference to the number of inmates, being returned as one household ; and the term "householder" was taken to mean the head of the family, or if absent, his locum tenens, wife, son, &amp; c. In the case of pastoral or other large establishments the occupier, whether proprietor, lessee, or</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_iv"></div>
			<p>superintendent, was considered as the householder, and required to fill in the schedule accordingly. Each schedule, however, did not necessarily represent a separate household, inasmuch as there were a great many separate returns for miners, &amp;c., who were the sole occupants of tents or huts, whose families residing in other parts of the Colony were also separately returned.</p>
			<p>After the schedules had been collected by those who were appointed for that purpose, they were delivered to the enumerators, whose duty it was to examine them, and to supply any omissions which they might detect, and after verification to return them to the Compiler at this office, accompanied by a summary of the population of the district, according to a form provided for that purpose. On the whole this duty was satisfactorily performed by the majority of the enumerators ; but there were some few of them who altogether ignored the instructions they had received, and sent in the schedules without any attempt at arrangement, and in the most embarrassing confusion. This fact, added to the delay in some districts in the collection of the schedules, in consequence of a protracted drought, materially delayed the preparation of the return which was submitted to Parliament. It was not until the beginning of August that the last of the schedules were returned to this office.
					<span class="annotation"> [Schedules returned to the Complier.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In order that the Census should be as accurate as possible, advertisements were inserted several times in all the principal newspapers of the Colony, requesting that those persons who might have been passed over by the collectors would advise the Compiler of the fact, that the omissions might be rectified. Another advertisement was inserted requesting that any schedules which had been delivered but not collected might be forwarded to this office. A few additional returns were received in consequence of these advertisements, but on the whole there were very few instances of omission or neglect on the part of the collectors. It was found however that the collection of the agricultural and pastoral returns was a source of considerable embarrassment to the collectors of the Census, and wherever an error had crept in it was found to be attributable to the amalgamation of the two duties.
					<span class="annotation"> [Steps taken to ensure accuracy.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The careful manner in which the duties of tabulation was performed, from which the tables now presented were compiled, justifies me in testifying to their general accuracy. The numbers of the people, making allowance for a few travellers or bushmen who may have escaped notice, form a correct return of the population on the 3rd of April, 1881. Unfortunately the details, which would have formed a most interesting part of the volume, are absent, which is a source of the sincerest regret to myself as well as the Compiler, who had bestowed upon them much arduous thought and labour.
					<span class="annotation"> [Correctness of the returns.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Certain forms were prepared for the tabulators, for the purpose of condensing the information contained in the schedules. This work was commenced in June, and completed on the 25th of October, 1881. The remuneration paid to the tabulators was at the rate of six shillings per hundred of the population for tabulation, and four shillings per hundred for revision. Every schedule was gone over twice ; first by the tabulators and then by the revisers, so that the greatest accuracy was ensured before the work of compilation was commenced.
					<span class="annotation"> [Tabulation.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Compilation was commenced immediately after the tabulators had completed their labours.
					<span class="annotation"> [Compilation.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The divisions of the Colony under which the information was grouped were as follows :—
					<span class="annotation"> [Divisions of the Colony.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>1st—The Electoral Districts.</p>
			<p>2nd—The Registration Districts and Sub-districts.</p>
			<p>3rd—The Towns and Villages.</p>
			<p>4th—The Municipalities.</p>
			<p>Of these, the Electoral Districts and the Registration Districts and Sub-districts were the principal, and as, for Census purposes, the Registration Districts had been made to coincide with the Electoral Districts, some repetition was necessary ; but in order to render the work as perfect as possible, the most minute details were given, which, but for the fire, would have made the present the most complete and comprehensive Census that has been taken in New South Wales.</p>
			<p>The towns and villages are contained in three lists of townships, containing a population of 100 persons or over (Returns 5, 6 and 7), whether their boundaries had been officially declared or not. The first return, No. 5, comprises those towns
					<span class="annotation"> [Towns and villages.] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_v"></div>
			<p>and villages whose populations had increased during the previous decennial period ; the second comprises those towns and villages whose populations had decreased ; and the third shows the populations of 122 new towns and villages which had sprung into existence since the Census of 1871.
					<span class="annotation"> [Towns and villages.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The information extracted by the tabulators from the schedules was divided into seven parts, namely :—
					<span class="annotation"> [Division of the compiled tables.] </span>
				</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Ages.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Birthplaces of the people.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Religion.</p>
				</li>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Social and conjugal condition.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Occupations.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each division of the Colony formed a separate series for every one of the above parts, and the information contained in each was of the most complete and exhaustive character.</p>
			<p>The tables which follow this Report form an interesting and complete epitome of the results obtained from the labours of the tabulators. Comparisons have been carried back as far as 1861 in most of the tables, and in one of them to the year 1821, when the first Census was taken in the Colony. Great difficulties were experienced in making these comparisons, in consequence of the alterations in the boundaries of the different divisions of the Colony. For the future these difficulties will not be likely to present themselves, as the boundaries of the Registry Census and Electoral Districts are now coincident and are not likely to be changed for many years to come.
					<span class="annotation"> [Centesimal and proportional tables.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The Census of 1861 was taken on the 7th of April, that of 1871 on the 2nd of April, and that of 1881 on the 3rd of April. A few days were wanted in the first decade to complete the ten years ; but the difference was so unimportant that it was considered unnecessary to increase the difficulties of the work by taking the broken period into account when the Census was taken in 1871. The second decade exceeds the ten years by one day, and for the same reason the extra day was not taken into account. The computations therefore for both decades have been made on the basis of two full decennial periods.

			<p>POPULATION</p>
			<p>PROGRESS OF THE COLONY</p>
			<p>As has been frequently pointed out on previous occasions, foremost among the elements of national and social wealth of a civilized country stands the power of population in its progress. This fact was specially dwelt upon in my Report on the Census Returns of 1871, in which I endeavoured to show that the natural increase of the population, namely, the excess of births over deaths, was influenced to a very great extent by the increase or decrease in immigration and emigration ; but from the character of the statistics at our command, it would be a matter of great difficulty—if not absolutely impossible—to arrive at the exact proportion which each cause contributed towards the general increase or decrease of the population. The same state of things still exists, although in a lesser degree, and as the Colony becomes more settled with a fixed population the difficulties of estimating the influence of the migratory movement upon the natural increase will gradually disappear.

			<p>The total increase of the population of New South Wales on the 3rd of April, 1881, for the previous ten years, was 247,487 persons, being 49.10 per cent. on the population of 1871, giving an annual rate of increase of 4.91 per cent. The addition to the population during the decennial period 1861-71 was 43.64 per cent., or at the yearly rate of 4.36 per cent., so that during the decade ending 1881 the increase was 5.36 per cent. greater than in the previous period. This is a very satisfactory result, seeing that the rate of increase during the period 1861-71 had fallen off considerably from the rate attained during the previous five years, namely, between 1856 and 1861.
					<span class="annotation"> [Progress of population between 1871 and 1881.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The falling off here alluded to was caused principally by an exodus over the borders of the adjoining Colonies - of which no record could be kept - in consequence of the important mineral discoveries which had been made in Victoria and Queensland. The cessation, also, of assisted immigration contributed materially to the falling off in the rate of increase of population.</p>
			<p>NUMBERS AND DISTRIBUTION.</p>
			<p>The population, exclusive of wandering aborigines, was, on 3rd April, 1881, 751,468, consisting of 411,149 males and 340,319 females. The numbers on the 2nd April, 1871, were 503,981 persons, consisting of 275,551 males and 228,430 females.
					<span class="annotation"> [Population of New South Wales.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The addition, therefore, as stated above, since the Census of 1871, was 247,487 persons, or 49.10 per cent. ; the males having increased by 135,598, or 49.20 per cent., and the females by 111,889, or 48.98 per cent. The increase during the previous decade was 38.82 per cent. for the males, and 49.91 per cent. for the females, by which it will be seen that while the males exceeded the increase of the decennial period 1861-71 by 10.38 per cent., the females decreased by 0.93 per cent. A careful study of these figures will show that the rate of increase in the male and female population during the last decade was very nearly equal, while in the previous ten years the females increased 11.09 per cent. more than the males.
					<span class="annotation"> [Increase as compared with previous Census.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The inequality of the sexes was very apparent in every Census that was taken up to 1861 ; but, as was pointed out in my Report on the Census Returns of 1871, such inequality was fast disappearing ; for while in 1861 there were for every 10,000 persons 5,657 males and 4,343 females, or a proportion of only 7,676 females to every 10,000 males, in 1871 the discrepancy had materially decreased, as there were 5,467 males and 4,533 females in every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 8,289 females to every 10,000 males. In 1881 the proportion remained very much the same, there being 5,471 males and 4,529 females to every 10,000 persons, or 8,277 females to every 10,000 males.
					<span class="annotation"> [Inequality of sexes.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The density of the population in 1871 was given in counties and pastoral districts ; but it was thought advisable when the Census was last taken to give the density of the various Census and Registration Districts, which had been assimilated to and made coincident with the Electoral Districts. This step was taken in order that comparison might be more accurately arrived at in future years.
					<span class="annotation"> [Density of population.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>This branch of the results of the Census is a question of great interest, and, considering the extent of the territory of the Colony, exemplifies the capabilities of the county to support an immense population.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_vii"></div>
			<p>The total area of the 72 Electoral Districts (which embrace the whole Colony) as furnished by the Surveyor-General, and as calculated with the Polar Planimeter, is 316,320.24 square miles, or about 202,500,000 acres.
					<span class="annotation"> [Area of the Colony.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The centesimal proportion of the population to the area of the Colony in 1881 was 2.36, as against 0.91 in 1856, 1.28 in 1861, and 1.64 in 1871.</p>
			<p>Some idea of the extent of territory as compared with the population may be gathered from what I said in my Report on the Census of 1871, and it will not be out of place again to give a few figures bearing upon this subject.</p>
			<p>Giving a square yard as standing-room to one individual, 4,800 persons would only occupy an acre of land, so that the whole population of the Colony could be placed on a little over 156 acres, or less than quarter of a square mile, and the area of the Colony is 316,320 square miles in extent.</p>
			<p>The density of the population of England is nearly 400 to the square mile, giving only about an acre and a-half to each individual ; while there are nearly 270 acres to every man, woman, and child in this Colony.</p>
			<p>Supposing the Colony of New South Wales to be as densely populated as England, our population would reach about 135 millions !</p>
			<p>Table No. 2 shows how unequally the population of the Colony is distributed.</p>
			<p>Leaving out the metropolitan and suburban districts as well as the principal towns, it will be seen that the density of the population varies in the several Electorates from 71.94 to 0.10 to the square mile.</p>
			<p>Again, leaving out the metropolitan and suburban Electorates, the most populous Electorate is Parramatta, with 3,243.08 persons to a square mile. West Maitland comes next, with 2,690.09 ; then follow Bathurst, with 1805.25 ; Goulburn, with 526.08 ; and Newcastle, with 499.87 persons to the square mile.</p>
			<p>In ascertaining the population of the towns and villages of the Colony very great difficulty was experienced, inasmuch as the official boundaries of a large number of these townships were not known, and in other cases, although there was no proclaimed township, the number of persons congregated in one spot rendered it essential that they should be considered as part of the urban population of the Colony. The fluctuations of population in various localities were very remarkable during the last decennial period, and it is more than probable that such fluctuations will continue at intervals for many years to come, especially in the mining districts, for wherever and whenever a new gold-field is discovered it is the signal for the abandoning of one locality for another. Townships which a short time before had been thronged with a busy population suddenly became almost deserted. The mining population—especially in the metals—is essentially migratory, and this fact will always account for the fluctuations of population which take place in the townships of the mining districts.
					<span class="annotation"> [Urban and rural population.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>A glance at tables Nos. 6 and 7 will show that during the period between 1871 and 1881, 37 townships decreased in population, while during the same time no fewer than 122 new towns and villages sprang into existence. Many of these places have not been declared towns and have no official recognition ; but the populations being in every case more than 100, and in some instances between 2,000 and 3,000, they necessarily belong to the urban population of the Colony.
					<span class="annotation"> [New townships.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In classifying the towns and villages, the Government boundaries were taken into consideration in all cases in which the enumerators possessed the necessary information, giving the urban and sub-urban population separately ; but as there were towns and villages without officially declared boundaries, the population within their approximate limits was carefully ascertained, and these places were included within the urban parts of the Colony in every case where the numbers reached 100 persons. In determining the urban and rural populations the same rule was adopted in 1881 as was followed in 1871.</p>
			<p>When the Census was taken in 1861 a great part of the suburban districts within the area of the metropolitan police district was included in the rural population ; but in 1871 and 1881 the whole of the suburbs of Sydney were included in the urban population. Fresh computations for 1861, on the basis adopted in 1871 and 1881, have been made, so that comparisons may be arrived at between the two decennial periods.
					<span class="annotation"> [Metropolitan suburban population.] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_viii"></div>
			<p>In 1881 the urban population was 433,391, and the rural population was 314,850. There were also located in ships, boats, &amp;c., 3,227. Thus, out of every 10,000 of the population, 5,766 resided in towns and villages and 4,192 in the rural parts of the Colony. In 1871 the numbers out of every 10,000 were 4,646 in the town and 5,306 in the country. In 1861 the numbers were 4,549 in the towns and 5,396 in the rural parts of the Colony. The above figures show what rapid strides have been made in towns and villages during the decennial period 1871-81, while during the previous ten years the proportions of the urban and rural populations were but little changed. From 1861 to 1871 there was only an increase of 97 persons in every 10,000 of the urban population, while in the succeeding period the increase in the towns reached 1,120 persons in every 10,000 of the urban population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Increase in the urban population.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>On referring to the tables showing the proportion of sexes, it will be found that the greatest difference exists naturally in the rural districts ; but this disproportion is gradually decreasing as the Colony increases in population, for although the towns have increased at a much greater rate than the country, yet the disproportion of sexes has decreased. In 1861, of the urban population the males numbered 80,449, or 40.53 per cent., and of the rural population in the same year the males numbered 116,197, or 58.54 per cent. The females of the urban population were 79,181, or 51.96 per cent., and of the rural population they numbered 73,123, or 47.99 per cent. In 1871 the numbers for the males were—urban, 117,513, or 42.64 per cent. ; rural, 155,680, or 56.50 per cent. For the females, urban, 116,649, or 51.06 per cent ; rural, 111,737, or 48.92 per cent. In 1881 there were 225,803 males, or 54.88 per cent. in the towns, and 182,187, or 44.35 per cent. in the rural districts. Of the female population there were 207,588, or 60.99 per cent. in the towns, and 132,663 or 38.99 per cent. in the country.

			<p>In 1871, of the 234,162 persons composing the urban population, there were 134,736 in the city of Sydney and suburbs, being 26.73 per cent. of the total population of the Colony ; the remainder, 99,426, or 19.73 per cent. of the population, resided in the towns and villages. In 1881, of the 433,391 persons composing the urban population, 220,984 resided in Sydney and suburbs, being 29.40 per cent. of the total population, and 212,407 or 28.26 per cent., in the country towns and villages. The rural population for the years 1871 and 1881 were respectively 267,417 or 53.06 per cent. and 314,850 or 41.92 per cent. of the total population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Sydney and suburbs.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 there were 166 towns and villages of 100 inhabitants and over, with an aggregate population of 99,426 persons. Of this number of towns there were 13 whose populations in 1881 had decreased to below 100, and they were accordingly struck out of the urban population and numbered with the rural ; but while these few towns had disappeared and some others had decreased, the remainder had increased in population very materially, as will be seen by reference to table No. 5. As has already been stated, no less a number than 122 new townships or centres of population had started into existence between the years 1871 and 1881, making an aggregate population, as before stated, of 212,407 persons. Thus, while in 1871, for every 10,000 of the population, there were 1,973 persons in the country towns and villages, in 1881 there were 2,826. So that while in 1871 the towns and villages contributed 2,187 persons in every 10,000 of the total increase, in 1881 they contributed not fewer than 4,565 in every 10,000 of the total increase during the last decennial period. A glance at conspectus table No. 3 will show what rapid strides the urban population has made.

			<p>With reference to the proportion of sexes in the country towns and villages, we had, in 1861, 2029 for every 10,000 of the female population and 1,764 for every 10,000 of the male population. In 1871 the numbers were for every 10,000 females 2,066 in the towns and villages, and for every 10,000 males 1,895. In 1881, for every 10,000 of the female population there were 2,861 in the towns and villages, and for every 10,000 males there were 2,797. The contribution towards the total increase of the population in the decennial period 1861—71 was 2,140 in every 10,000 females and 2,232 in every 10,000 males by the country towns and villages. In the period 1871—1881 the contribution of the towns and villages towards the total increase of the population was no less than 4,484 in every 10,000 females and 4,631 in every 10,000 males of such increase.

			<p>In the urban parts of the Colony, in 1861, there were 9,842 females for every 10,000 males, and in the rural parts there were 6,293 for every 10,000 males. In 1871 the numbers were 9,926 urban and 7,176 rural for every 10,000 males. In 1881 the females had decreased to 9,193 for every 10,000 males in the urban parts, but had increased to 7,281 for every 10,000 males in the rural districts. The greater disproportion of the sexes in the country towns in 1881 is accounted for by the fact that there had been a great influx of males during the latter part of the last decade to the mining localities, which are included amongst the country towns and villages.</p>
			<p>There has been a very large increase in the number of towns containing a population of over 1,000 persons, since 1871. At that time there were only 26, but by reference to return No. 14, it will be seen that when the Census was taken in 1881, there were 59 towns whose populations had reached 1,000 and over, and of these 16 had no existence in 1871, but had become established townships through the influx of the mining population. It is quite probable, however, that some of these last may, during the next decade, cease to be numbered amongst what are considered as "principal towns," as their existence of course depends upon the permanency of the gold-fields which have attracted the population. The rest, however, including Lithgow, Wallerawang, Bulli, Hamilton, Wickham, Lambton, Minmi, and Wallsend, may be fairly considered as permanently numbered amongst the principal towns of the Colony, as their populations are not dependent upon the uncertain and fluctuating character of gold-mining, but belong mainly to the more permanent industry of coal-mining.
					<span class="annotation"> [Principal towns.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the old established towns, Newcastle, Parramatta, Bathurst, Goulburn, West Maitland, Albury, Grafton, Wagga Wagga, and Tamworth, come first in importance, their populations numbering respectively, 8,986, 8,432, 7,221, 5,881, 5,300, 4,040, 3,891, 3,975, and 3,612. Of these Tamworth has made the most rapid progress, her increase being at the rate of 13.90 per cent. annually. Wagga Wagga comes next, with an increase of 11.39 per cent. annually. Then follow Albury, with an annual increase of 11.20 per cent. ; Grafton, 7.29 per cent. ; Bathurst, 4.36 per cent. ; Parramatta, 3.82 per cent. ; Goulburn, 3.21 per cent. ; Newcastle, 1.85 per cent. ; and West Maitland, with 0.43 per cent. Up to the time of the Census of 1871, Newcastle had made the greatest progress in the increase of her population, and Parramatta the smallest ; but during the last decennial period Parramatta has recovered her rate of increase so considerably that she has outstripped Newcastle by 2 per cent. annually. The largest increase however of urban population will be found to have taken place</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_x"></div>
			<p>in Narrandera and Wilcannia, the former having increased at the rate of 70.42 per cent., and the latter 43.94 per cent. annually. Next in order come Moama, with 38.85 per cent. ; Glen Innes, 28.69 per cent. ; Dubbo, 28.26 per cent. ; Bourke, 25.79 per cent. ; Bega, 21.66 per cent. ; Hay, 21.22 per cent. ; Forbes, 20.86 per cent. ; and Gunnedah, with 19.00 per cent. annually ; the remaining towns varying from 0.43 to 13.81 per cent. annually.</p>
			<p>Only three which are numbered amongst the principal towns of the Colony have decreased in population during the last decade, namely, Braidwood, Grenfell, and Muswellbrook : Braidwood from 1,197 to 1,066, Grenfell from 1,657 to 1,575, and Muswellbrook from 1,445 to 1,074. Those towns which showed a decrease in population between 1861 and 1871 more than recovered themselves in the next decennial period, with one exception, that exception being West Maitland, whose population in 1861-71 and 81 was respectively 5,694, 5,079, and 5,300.</p>
			<p>The population of Sydney proper, on the 3rd April, 1881, exclusive of shipping, was 100,152 persons, consisting of 51,242 males and 48,910 females. In 1871 the total population was 74,423 persons, 36,149 males and 38,274 females, the numerical increase being 15,093 males and 10,636 females, or 25,729 persons. The rate of increase was 4.15 per cent. annually for the males, and 2.78 per cent. annually for the females, or an average of 3.46 per cent. for the total population of the town. In comparing these figures with those of the decennial period 1861-71, it will be seen that there is a very material difference in the rates ; for in 1871 the increase was at the rate of 3.25 per cent. annually for the males and 3.15 per cent. for the females, so that for the males there was a difference at the rate of 0.90 per cent. in favour of 1881, while for the females the difference was 0.37 per cent. in favour of 1871.
					<span class="annotation"> [Sydney.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The improvement in the rate of increase of the total population of the town has continued since 1861 ; for while it was only at the rate of 1.2 per cent. annually for the preceding quinquennial period, it was at the rate of 3.20 per cent. for the following decennial period, and 3.46 per cent. for the decade ending 1881.</p>
			<p>During the last decennial period there has been a very marked difference in the proportion of sexes in the city of Sydney as compared with the previous ten years. From 1861 to 1871 the proportion was very evenly maintained from year to year. In 1861 there were 4,866 males and 5,134 females for every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 10,551 females to every 10,000 males ; in 1871 there were 4,961 males and 5,039 females for every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 10,156 females to every 10,000 males ; but for the last decennial period the numbers are 5,116 males and 4,884 females for every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 9,546 females to every 10,000 males.</p>

			<p>It will be seen by the above that from 1828 to 1861 all the intervening periods with one exception are quinquennial, and that the last two, namely 1861—71 and 1871—81, are decennial.

			<p>As was pointed out in my Report for 1871, the Metropolitan population does not merely consist of those living in the town of Sydney proper, but includes those residing in the suburbs. These suburbs with the city compose the Metropolitan Police District. The aggregate population of the suburbs in 1881 was 120,832 persons, consisting of 59,527 males and 61,305 females. They are divided into seven Electoral or Registry Districts as follows :—

			<p>Although the population of the Suburbs of Sydney had increased during the decennial period ending in 1871 at the rate of 6.37 per cent. annually, the increase during the last decade far outstripped that of the preceding ten years, the population having more than doubled. In 1871 the population was 60,324, consisting of 29,148 males and 31,176 females, so that the numerical increase is 60,508 persons, consisting of 30,379 males and 30,129 females, being an addition to the suburban population of 100.30 per cent., or 104.22 per cent. to the males and 96.64 to the females. The annual rate of increase, 10.03 per cent., is more than two and a half times greater than that of the town, and as time advances the Suburbs must of necessity extend and the population proportionately increase, while the City will be unable to afford further accommodation for her residents. The limits of the City have long been too circumscribed to give house-room for more than one half of those who get their livelihood within her boundaries.</p>
			<p>The Suburb of Balmain has gained the highest rate of increase during the last decennial period, namely, 145.84 per cent.; Newtown comes next, with 138.52 per cent., and St. Leonards with 114.78 per cent. The lowest rate of increase is in Paddington, being 77.19 per cent.</p>
			<p>The population of the town and suburbs within the boundaries of the Metropolitan Police District in 1881 was 220,985, consisting of 110,770 males and 110,215 females. In 1871 the numbers were 134,736 persons, consisting of 65,286 males and 69,450 females. The numerical increase during the ten years was, for the males, 45,484, and for the females 40,765, or 86,249 for both sexes, being an addition of no less than 69.66 per cent. for the males and 58.67 per cent. for the females, or 64.01 per cent. together.
					<span class="annotation"> [Town of Sydney and suburbs.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871, out of a suburban population of 60,324, there were nineteen municipalities, containing together 49,962 persons. Since that time eight new municipalities have been incorporated; and in 1881, out of a population of 120,832, no less a number than 106,374 persons lived within the limits of the various municipalities, so that but a very insignificant portion of the Metropolitan Police District remains unincorporated.
					<span class="annotation"> [Municipalities.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The Colony generally has availed itself largely of the benefits of the Municipalities Act during the last decade. In 1861 there were only twenty-four Municipalities, with an aggregate population of 102,476 ; in 1871 there were forty-nine, with a population of 192,181, being an increase on the decennial period 1861—71 of twenty-five Municipalities and 89,705 persons. In 1881 there were ninety Municipalities, embracing a population of 355,199 persons, giving an increase in the decade of forty-one Municipalities and 163,018 persons, by which it will be seen that nearly one-half of the total population of the Colony is incorporated.</p>
			<p>For every 10,000 of the population in 1871 there were 3,813 persons living within the Municipalities, against 6,187 unincorporated; in 1881 the incorporated portions of the Colony contained 4,726 persons in every 10,000, against 5,274 in those parts which were not incorporated.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xii"></div>
			<p>Taking the total increase of the population of the Colony during the last decennial period, we find that for every 10,000 of such increase, 6,587 were contributed by the Municipalities, and 3,413 by the other parts of the Colony.</p>

			<p>The above return shows the uneven growth of the population in the three Electorates of the City of Sydney. It was pointed out, in my Report of the Census of 1871, how the tendency of the city was to spread out towards the east, and the Census of 1881 shows the same to a greater extent. Unfortunately the fire at the Garden Palace destroyed the details of the population of each Ward, but the preserved returns show the rapid strides of South Sydney, comprising Cook and Phillip Wards, as compared with the other portions of the town. The increase during the decade in South Sydney was 60.24 per cent., West Sydney, 29.97 per cent., and East Sydney, 16.11 per cent. The latter comprising the older and more thickly populated parts of the City must necessarily show a much smaller increase, inasmuch as there is but little space that is not already built upon and occupied.</p>
			<p>The rearrangement of the boundaries of the Census Districts to make them coincident with those of the Electoral Districts prevents an exact comparison being made between what were formerly known as the Settled Counties and the Pastoral Districts ; but the distribution of the people in the Colony will be shown by a comparison between those electorates which are situated in what were previously known as the Settled Counties and the remaining electorates situated in the Pastoral Districts. There are forty-six electorates in the Settled Counties, having an area of 60,557.95 square miles and a population of 528,327 persons. The electorates in the Pastoral Districts are twenty-six in number, with an area of 255,762.29 square miles and a population of 219,914 persons. So that the electorates within the boundaries of what were formerly termed the Settled Counties contain 70.61 per cent. of the total population, and the Pastoral Electorates 29.39 per cent. In 1871 the percentage was 74.72 and 25.28 respectively for the Settled Counties and Pastoral Districts, and the difference may be accounted for by the very large increase of the urban population in many of the electorates within the Pastoral Districts. The addition to the population in the electorates within the Pastoral Districts. The addition to the population in the electorates within the Settled Counties between 1871 and 1881 was 40.29 per cent., or at the rate of 4.03 per cent. annually. The increase in the pastoral parts of the Colony in the same period was 72.62 per cent., or at the rate of 7.26 per cent. annually.
					<span class="annotation"> [Counties and Pastoral Districts.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Taking the sexes separately in these two divisions of the Colony, we find that in 1871 there were 198,814 or 72.15 per cent. of the male population in the Counties, and 76,737 or 27.85 per cent. in the Pastoral Districts. In 1881 there were 269,348, or 66.02 per cent. of the male population, in the electorates within those counties, and 138,642, or 33.98 per cent., in the electorates within the Pastoral Districts. Of the total female population in 1871, 177,769, or 77.82 per cent., were located in the Settled Counties, and 50,661, or 22.18 per cent., in the Pastoral Districts. In 1881 there were 258,979, or 76.11 per cent., in the County Electorates, and 81,272, or 23.89 per cent., in the Pastoral Electorates. It will be seen therefore that, during the last decade, the proportions in the County Electorates and Pastoral Electorates had been very evenly maintained.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xiii"></div>
			<p>The rate of increase for both sexes in these two divisions of the Colony during the last decennial period shows a vastly different result from what was exhibited in the period 1861—71. In that decade, in the counties the increase was 31.15 per cent. for the males and 36.88 per cent. for the females, but in the pastoral districts the rate for the males was 70.33 per cent., while for the females it exceeded 125.82 per cent. The great excess in the increase of the female population bore out the theory that there was a steady progress in the equalization of the sexes. During the decennial period 1871—81 the increase in the county electorates was 35.48 per cent. for the males and 45.68 per cent. for the females, being over 10 per cent. in favour of the female population ; but in the pastoral electorates the increase was 81.06 per cent. for the males and only 60.42 per cent. for the females, being over 20 per cent. in favour of the male population.</p>
			<p>In 1871 there were in the counties 5,279 males and 4,721 females for every 10,000 persons, or 8,941 females to every 10,000 males. In the pastoral districts the numbers were 6,023 males and 3,977 females in every 10,000 persons, or 6,602 females for every 10,000 males. In 1881, in every 10,000 persons in the county electorates there were 5,098 males and 4,902 females, or 9,615 females to every 10,000 males. In the pastoral electorates, in every 10,000 persons there were 6,304 males and 3,696 females, or 5,862 females to every 10,000 males, so that it will be seen that during the last decade the proportion of the female population to that of the male population increased in the county electorates and decreased in the pastoral parts of the Colony.</p>
			<p>DOMICILIATION</p>
			<p>The next part of my Report refers to the domiciliation of the people ; and, by reference to table No. 17 it will be seen that in 1881, 748,241 persons, forming the population of the Colony exclusive of shipping, inhabited 135,326 dwellings of all descriptions, 44,417 of which were built of brick or stone, 70,423 of weatherboard, 964 of metal, 12,070 of inferior material, including slab, bark, &amp;c., and 7,452 of which were tents, drays, &amp;c. In addition to these there were 6,016 empty stores, uninhabited houses or buildings, churches, chapels, &amp;c., and 2,398 buildings in progress of construction. In 1871 the total number of inhabited dwellings was 93,690, of which 28,497 were of brick or stone, 50,800 weatherboard, 11,973 inferior, and 2,420 tents, drays, &amp;c. Of uninhabited buildings and buildings in course of construction - which were not separately distinguished - there were 4,917. The large increase in the number of tents, drays, &amp;c., may be accounted for by the impetus given to railway construction in various parts of the Colony.
					<span class="annotation"> [Lodgement of the people.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 there were 196 dwellings to every 1,000 inhabitants, or a proportion of 5.11 persons to each dwelling. In 1881 there were 192 dwellings to every 1,000 persons, or a proportion of 5.20 persons to each dwelling. During the decennial period there appears therefore to have been a decrease of four dwellings to every 1,000 of the population, and a corresponding increase in the density of habitation of 0.09 persons to each dwelling ; showing that the population had increased with greater rapidity than the construction of dwellings for their accommodation.
					<span class="annotation"> [Density of habitation.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The density of habitation of the principal towns in 1881 varied considerably, namely, from an average of 3.08 to 6.89 persons to each dwelling ; the former being the average at Balranald, and the latter at Wagga Wagga. The towns of Liverpool and Parramatta show a higher average, but as that is caused by the gaols and other institutions, they have not been included in this comparison.</p>

			<p>The foregoing table shows that the accommodation for the inhabitants of the city has not increased in proportion with the increase of population during the decade, there being an increase of 0.66 persons to each dwelling. Of the suburbs Redfern only comes under the same category as Sydney, there being an increase of 0.44 persons to each dwelling ; the remainder of the suburbs have more than kept pace with the increase of population, the density having decreased in every case but that of Redfern.</p>
			<p>AGES.</p>
			<p>In the tables of the ages the population has been tabulated in quinquennial periods up to the age of 20 years, the next period is 20 to 21 years, the next 21 to 25, and again in quinquennial periods up to 80. The last three columns are devoted to persons between the ages of 80 and 100 years, to those of 100 years and upwards, and to those whose ages were unspecified. In the detailed tables which were destroyed in the fire the numbers of persons were shown at each year of age up to 21 years.
					<span class="annotation"> [Mode of grouping.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Adopting the plan of 1861 and 1871, it will be necessary to divide the population into three groups, classing as children all under 15 years of age, as adults representing the effective strength of the community those between 15 and 65 years of age, and as non-effective adults all persons over 65 years of age.
					<span class="annotation"> [Effective and non-effective portions of the population.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the 751,468 individuals forming the population of 1881, 298,620 or 39.74 per cent. were children under 15 years of age, 434,497 (including the unspecified ages) or 57.82 per cent. were adults between 15 and 65, and 18,351 or 2.44 per cent. were over 65 years of age.</p>
			<p>In 1871, 210,183 or 41.71 per cent. of the population were under 15 years, 283,087 or 56.17 per cent. were adults between 15 and 65 years of age, and 10,711 or 2.12 per cent. were over 65.</p>
			<p>The increase in the decade was therefore 88,437 or 42.08 per cent, for children under 15 years of age, 151,410 or 53.48 per cent. for adults between 15 and 65, and 7,640 or 71.33 per cent. for persons over 65 years.</p>
			<p>Taking the population under 15 years, and over 65 years of age as non-effective and dependent upon those between those ages for support, we have in 1881 for every 10,000 of the population 5,782 effective and 4,218 non-effective persons, against 5,620 effective and 4,380 non-effective in 1871, showing an improvement in the effective portion of the population of 162 in every 10,000 persons.</p>
			<p>In 1871 as compared with 1861 there was a falling off of 450 effectives in every 10,000 persons ; and it is gratifying to know that the effective portion of the community has so much improved during the decade, considering that in the previous decennial period there had been such a serious decrease.</p>
			<p>The self-supporting classes in England are taken to be between 20 and 60 years of age, and the proportion of those belonging to the non-effective class remain pretty constant, not varying more than ten persons in every 10,000 of the population in a decade, the numbers being 5,230 and 5,240 respectively in the years 1871 and 1881.</p>
			<p>Taking the sexes separately, in 1881 we have, out of a total male population of 411,149, 151,117 or 36.75 per cent. of the whole number under 15 years of age ; 248,515 or 60.45 per cent. between the ages of 15 and 65, and 11,517 or 2.80 per cent. over 65 years of age. In 1871 the percentage of the male population was for children under 15, 38.69 per cent., for those between the ages of 15 and 65, 58.67 per cent., and for those over 65 years of age 2.62 per cent.
					<span class="annotation"> [Sexes.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the female population numbering 340,319 in 1881, 147,503 or 43.34 per cent. were under 15,185,982 or 54.65 per cent. were between the ages of 15 and 65, and 6,834 or 2.01 per cent. were over 65 years of age. In 1871 the percentage was 45.34 per cent. for children under 15, 53.16 per cent. for adults between 15 and 65, and 1.50 per cent. for those over 65 years of age.</p>
			<p>In examining the proportion of one sex to the other, it will be found that in 1881, for every 10,000 persons of the effective population 5,720 were males and 4,280 females, and for every 10,000 of the remainder or non-effective class 5,131 were males and 4,869 females. In 1871, for every 10,000 of the active class,
					<span class="annotation"> [Proportion of sexes.] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xv"></div>
			<p>there were 5,710 males and 4,290 females, and for every 10,000 of the remainder there were 5,156 males and 4,944 females. Thus it will be seen that the proportion of sexes has remained substantially the same during the last decade, whilst in 1861 there were nearly twice the number of males compared with the number of females belonging to the self-supporting or effective population. The above figures show very clearly that the disproportion of sexes which was so apparent in former Censuses is fast disappearing.
					<span class="annotation"> [Proportion of sexes.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between the years 1861 and 1871 there was a very noticeable increase in the number of persons over 65 years of age, varying at different ages from 146.18 per cent. to 85.39 per cent., and during the last decennial period the same extraordinary rate of increase has nearly been maintained ; for instance, in 1881 there were 8,282 persons between the ages of 65 and 70, against 4,850 in 1871, an addition of 3,432 or 70.76 per cent. in the decade. Between the ages of 70 and 75 there were 5,518 persons in 1881 against 3,609 in 1871, giving a numerical increase of 1,909 or 52.89 per cent. Between 75 and 80 there were 2,637 persons in 1881 against 1,275 in 1871, giving an increase of 1,362 persons or 106.82 per cent. Over 80 years of age there were in 1881 1,914 persons against 977 in 1871, showing an increase of 937 persons or 95.90 per cent.
					<span class="annotation"> [Persons over 65 years of age.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>I pointed out in my Report on the Census of 1871 that, with reference to persons of a reputed age of 100 years and upwards, we had but little documentary evidence of the truth of the statements made by supposed centenarians, whose loss of memory often led them to exaggerate their age ; I could therefore only give the numbers as extracted from the schedules, without expressing any opinion as to the correctness of the returns in this respect. Eighteen persons were put down as centenarians in 1871, and the number returned in 1881 was twenty-six. In both periods the proportion was about 3½ reputed centenarians to every 100,000 of the population, so that it may be assumed that the numbers were tolerably correct, both in 1871 and 1881, seeing that the same proportion was maintained during the decade. In England there is only one centenarian to every 100,000 persons.

			<p>By the above return it will be seen that for 1881 the sexes were pretty equally divided up to the age of 20 years ; above that age the preponderance of the male population goes on increasing ; but in 1871 and 1881 there is a marked improvement over 1861, and this improvement seems to increase every year. In 1861 and 1871 the female population between the ages of 15 and 20 was greater than the male population by 459 in 10,000 in 1861, and by 224 in every 10,000 in 1871. This singular preponderance disappears in 1881.</p>
			<p>The grouping of the population into three periods of age, namely, under 15 years of age, 15 and under 65, and 65 and over, was adopted in order that the results of the Census of 1881 might be compared with the previous Census years ; but in 1871 I also grouped the population into four series of age, namely - infants under 5, children between 5 and 15, adults between 15 and 60, and adults aged 60 and upwards. In 1881 I have grouped them as under : infants under 5, children between 5 and 15, adults between 15 and 21, between 21 and 50, between 50 and 70, and 70 and upwards.
					<span class="annotation"> [Improvement in the way of grouping the population.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Under the latter mode of grouping, tables 22 and 23 will give a comparison between the urban and rural parts of the Colony in 1881, as regards numbers, percentage of population, and the proportion of sexes at each of the six periods of age. These tables will serve as a basis for future comparison.
					<span class="annotation"> [Ages in the urban and rural parts of the Colony.] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xvi"></div>
			<p>Taking the urban population first. For infants under 5 years of age there were in 1881 4,974 males and 5,026 females in every 10,000 persons ; children between 5 and 15, there were 4,902 males and 5,098 females in every 10,000 ; between 15 and 21, 4,790 males and 5,210 females ; between 21 and 50, 5,475 males and 4,525 females ; between 50 and 70, 5,805 males and 4,195 females ; and 70 and upwards, the numbers were 5,804 males and 4,196 females in every 10,000 persons.</p>
			<p>The rural population shows that for every 10,000 infants under 5 years there were 5,165 males and 4,835 females ; for children between 5 and 15 years there were 5,264 males and 4,736 females ; between the ages of 15 and 21, 5,350 males and 4,650 females ; between 21 and 50, 6,271 males and 3,729 females ; between 50 and 70, 6,713 males and 3,287 females, and at 70 and upwards there were 6,976 males and 3,024 females in every 10,000 persons.</p>
			<p>By the foregoing it will be seen that in the urban parts of the Colony up to 21 years of age the female population preponderated, but beyond that age the male population was the greatest.</p>
			<p>In the rural parts of the Colony the male population is the most numerous at all ages.</p>
			<p>Table No. 24 is the last bearing on the ages of the people. This table gives for each electorate the number of adult males of the age of 21 years and upwards ; and (deducting from these the police, soldiers, Chinese, aborigines, foreigners who had not been naturalized, and also prisoners in gaols, and inmates of asylums), the estimated number of electors. It will be seen that in 1881 there were in the 72 electorates 211,813 adult males of 21 years and over, giving after the foregoing deductions, 195,869 as the estimated number of electors, or a proportion of 2,606 electors in every 10,000 persons. The total number of Members of the Legislative Assembly being 108, the average is 1,814 electors to a Member. The exact number of males in the Colony of 21 years and over, including the shipping, was 214,296, representing 28.52 per cent. of the population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Electorates—Males of 21 years of age and over.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 there were only 57 electorates, giving 2,610 electors in every 10,000 persons. There were then 69 Members of the Assembly, and an average of 1,897 electors to a Member. The total number of adult males of 21 years of age and over was 143,730, representing 28.52 per cent. of the population—exactly the same as in 1881.</p>
			<p>NATIONALITY OR BIRTH-PLACES OF THE PEOPLE.</p>
			<p>It has already been pointed out that foremost among the elements of national wealth and prosperity stands the power of population ; and as the progress of the Colony of New South Wales has hitherto depended to a large extent upon immigration from other countries, it is of great importance to trace the growth of the various nationalities within the Colony, and to determine the importance of the native-born population as compared with those who were born in other countries.</p>
			<p>The inquiry into the subject of the birth-places of the people will be divided into two parts. First, the division of the people into British and Foreign subjects, and second a distinction of the countries in which they were born.</p>
			<p>A careful examination of the conspectus tables bearing upon this subject will be interesting, as they immediately convey to the mind the magnitude of the various populations, and are a great assistance to the reader in enabling him to compare one nationality with another.
					<span class="annotation"> [Conspectus tables.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the 751,468 persons according to the Census of 1881, there were 720,422 British subjects, 28,519 Foreign subjects, 836 persons whose nationality was not stated, and 1,691 born at sea. Of the British subjects, 384,901 were males and 335,521 were females ; of the Foreign subjects, 24,698 were males and 3,821 were females ; of the unspecified and those born at sea, 1,550 were males and 977 were females.
					<span class="annotation"> [British and Foreign subjects.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Counted amongst the British subjects there were 1,643 aborigines who formed a part of the settled population of the Colony, of whom 938 were males and 705 females.</p>
			<p>Taking only the population whose nationality is stated, we find that 96.19 per cent. are British, and 3.81 per cent. Foreign subjects. Of the males, 93.97 per cent. were British, and 6.03 per cent. Foreign. Of the females, 98.87 per cent. were British and 1.13 per cent. Foreign subjects.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xvii"></div>
			<p>The proportion of the sexes of the British subjects are yearly becoming more equal. There were in 1881 5,342 males and 4,658 females in every 10,000 British subjects, or a proportion of 8,717 females to every 10,000 males ; but the disparity of numbers in the sexes of foreign subjects is very great, there being 8,661 males and only 1,339 females to every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 1,545 females to every 10,000 males.
					<span class="annotation"> [Proportion of sexes.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Compared with the preceding Census, the proportion of sexes of the British subjects has improved slightly, the numbers being in 1871, 5,353 males and 4,647 females in every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 8,682 females to every 10,000 males. In the foreign element, however, the disparity is even greater than it was in 1871, there being at that time 8,455 males and 1,545 females in every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 1,827 females to every 10,000 males.</p>
			<p>The population of the Colony may be classed under three principal heads:—the Australian-born, the natives of Great Britain and other parts of the British dominions, and those born in foreign countries.
					<span class="annotation"> [Birth-places of the people.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1881 there were 511,910 persons who were born in the Australian Colonies, of whom 467,202 were natives of New South Wales, including 1,643 aborigines, 208,512 persons born in Great Britain and other British possessions, and 28,519 born in foreign countries, forming with 2,527 born at sea, and of unspecified nationality, the total population.</p>
			<p>Thus, of the total population, 68.12 per cent. were Australian-born, 27.74 per cent. were born in Great Britain and British dependencies, and 4.14 per cent. in foreign countries, at sea, and unspecified birth-places.</p>
			<p>In 1871 61.30 per cent. were Australian-born, 34.59 per cent. were born in Great Britain and other British dependencies, and 4.11 per cent. in foreign countries, at sea, and unspecified birth-places.</p>
			<p>In 1861 the percentage of Australian-born was 47.14 per cent. of persons born in Great Britain, and other British dependencies 46.30 per cent., and of persons born in foreign countries and at sea 6.56 per cent.</p>
			<p>The following table shows the percentages at the Censuses of 1861, 1871, and 1881 respectively:—</p>
			<table border="1" summary="NSW-1881-census-02_xvii-1"><thead><tr><th>Year.</th><th>Percentage of Australian-born subjects.</th><th>Percentage of persons born in Great Britain and other British dependencies.</th><th>Percentage of Foreign-born subjects, persons born at Sea, and at unspecified birth-places.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>1861</th><td>47.14</td><td>46.30</td><td>6.56</td></tr><tr><th>1871</th><td>61.30</td><td>34.59</td><td>4.11</td></tr><tr><th>1881</th><td>68.12</td><td>27.74</td><td>4.14</td></tr></tbody></table>
			<p>It will be seen by the above, that while the percentages of the Australian-born and of other British subjects were nearly equal in 1861, the increase of the percentage of persons born in the Australian Colonies was very marked in 1871, which was partly accounted for by the comparative cessation of immigration during the decade. The natural increase of the native-born must of necessity augment year by year, although the proportion during the last decade does not show so great a difference as was observable in the previous decennial period, and this of course is attributable to the larger amount of immigration between 1871 and 1881 than in the previous ten years.
					<span class="annotation"> [Increase of the Australian-born.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the total increase of the population in the last decennial period we find that to every 10,000 of such increase the Australian-born contributed 8,212, others of British nationality 1,387, and foreign-born 401; while in the previous decade, in every 10,000 of the increase, 9,382 were Australian-born, only 792 other British subjects, and the foreign element showed a decrease of 174.</p>
			<p>Of the 511,910 Australian-born subjects, 465,559 or 61.96 per cent. of the population were natives of New South Wales, and 46,351 or 6.16 per cent. were born in the other Australian Colonies. In 1871 the numbers were 294,244 or 58.38 per cent. of the population for New South Wales, and 14,429 or 2.86 per cent. for the other Australian Colonies.</p>
			<p>The increase in the decennial period was therefore 171,315 or 58.22 per cent. for New South Wales, and 31,922 or 221.24 per cent. of their number for the other Colonies.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xviii"></div>
			<p>Of the 208,512 persons in 1881 who were born in Great Britain and other British possessions, 107,574 or 14.31 per cent. of the total population were born in England, 3,100 or 0.41 per cent. in Wales, 25,079 or 3.34 per cent. in Scotland, 69,192 or 9.21 per cent. in Ireland, and 3,567 or 0.47 per cent. in other British possessions.
					<span class="annotation"> [Great Britain and British dependencies.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 the numbers were 87,334 or 17.33 per cent. of the population born in England, 1,870 or 0.37 per cent. in Wales, 20,041 or 3.98 per cent. in Scotland, 62,943 or 12.49 per cent. in Ireland, and 1,979 or 0.39 per cent. in other British possessions.</p>
			<p>The increase to the number of the English-born in the decade was 20,242, or 23.16 per cent. ; to the Welsh, 1,230, or 65.77 per cent. ; to the Scotch, 5,038, or 25.13 per cent. ; to the Irish, 6,249, or 9.92 per cent. ; and to those born in other British possessions, 1,588, or 80.24 per cent. of their numbers.</p>
			<p>In the previous decennial period ending 1871 the addition to the numbers of the English-born was very small, being only 3,182, or 3.78 per cent. ; to the Welsh, 492 persons, or 35.70 per cent. ; to the Scotch, 1,819, or 9.98 per cent. ; and to the Irish, 8,114, or 14.79 per cent. of their numbers.</p>
			<p>The resumption of immigration after the year 1871 will account for the large increase in the percentage additions to the persons born in Great Britain, during the last decade, as compared with the previous decennial period.</p>
			<p>The proportion in which the British-born stood to the total population increased between the years 1871 and 1881 by 19.38 per cent. for England, 30.07 per cent. for Wales, 15.15 per cent. for Scotland, while for Ireland there was a decrease of 4.87 per cent.
					<span class="annotation"> [Proportion of the British to the total population.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>This is a vast improvement on the previous decennial period, when the proportion in which the British-born stood to the total population had decreased by 6.39 per cent. for England, 0.02 per cent. for Wales, 1.23 per cent. for Scotland, and 3.17 per cent. for Ireland.</p>
			<p>Of the 28,519 persons born in Foreign Countries, 2,518 or 0.34 per cent. of the population were from the United States, 1,497 or 0.20 per cent. from France, 7,521 or 1.00 per cent. from Germany, 1,069 or 0.14 per cent. from Denmark, 1,755 or 0.23 per cent. from Sweden and Norway. Reference to table 26 will also show the numbers contributed by other Foreign Countries, the particulars of which have been given for 1881, but which were omitted in previous Census years.
					<span class="annotation"> [Foreign Countries.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 the numbers were 1,340 or 0.27 per cent. from the United States, 891 or 0.18 per cent. from France, and 6,623 or 1.32 per cent. from Germany.</p>
			<p>The addition to their numbers in the decade was therefore 1,178 or 87.91 per cent. for the United States ; 606 or 68.01 per cent. for France, and 898 or 13.56 per cent. for Germany ; and the proportion in which the United States and France stood to our population increased in the same period by 0.07 and 0.02 per cent. respectively, while Germany decreased by 0.32 per cent.</p>
			<p>The numbers of Chinese, which in 1871 were 7,220 or 1.43 per cent. of the population, had increased in 1881 to 10,205 or 1.36 per cent. of the population. They had therefore increased numerically by 2,985, but had decreased proportionately by 0.07 per cent. of the total population, the increase on their numbers being 41.34 per cent.
					<span class="annotation"> [Chinese.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Taking the males and females separately, we find that during the decade the proportion of sexes of all British-born has been wonderfully steady. Thus, for every 10,000 persons born in the British Empire there were 5,342 males and 4,658 females in 1881, against 5,345 males and 4,655 females in 1871, being a difference only of three persons in 10,000 in favour of the females. In 1881 there were 8,717 females to every 10,000 males British-born, against 8,708 females in 1871.
					<span class="annotation"> [Proportion of sexes.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The Australian-born show a great equality of sexes for the last twenty years, the natives of this Colony numbering 80,106 males and 80,192 females in 1861, 147,877 males and 146,367 females in 1871, and 235,515 and 232,044 females in 1881. For the whole of the Australian Colonies there were 82,548 males and 82,444 females in 1861, 155,734 males and 152,939 females in 1871, and 259,233 males and 252,677 females in 1881.</p>
			<p>The proportion of sexes for the Australian-born population was therefore, in 1861, 5,003 males and 4,997 females in every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 9,987 females to every 10,000 males ; in 1871, 5,045 males and 4,955 females in</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xix"></div>
			<p>every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 9,820 females to every 10,000 males ; and in 1881, 5,064 males and 4,936 females in every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 9,747 females to every 10,000 males. And for the natives of New South Wales, in 1861, there were 4,997 males and 5,003 females in every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 10,011 females to every 10,000 males ; in 1871 the numbers were 5,026 males and 4,974 females in every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 9,898 females to every 10,000 males. In 1881 there were 5,016 males and 4,984 females in every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 9,937 females to every 10,000 males. By the above figures it will be seen that during the decade 1861-71 the proportion of females had decreased by 113 in every 10,000, and in the following decade the proportion had improved by 39 in every 10,000.</p>
			<p>The English-born have shown a decrease in the proportion of females from 5,829 to every 10,000 males in 1861, to 5,689 in 1871, and 5,643 in 1881 ; the Scotch, from 6,556 in 1861 to 6,509 in 1871, and 5,844 in 1881 ; the Irish, from 9,858 in 1861 to 9,716 in 1871, and 8,960 in 1881. The Welsh, however, have increased from a proportion of 5,109 females to every 10,000 males in 1861, to 5,141 in 1871, and 5,362 in 1881.</p>
			<p>The number of females arriving from foreign countries is, in proportion to the males, very small, although there has been a slight increase in the case of the United States and France during the last decennial period. From Germany the proportion has decreased. In 1881 there were from America a proportion at the rate of 2,932 females to every 10,000 males, against 2,407 in 1871 ; from France, 2,423 females to every 10,000 males, against 2,306 in 1871 ; and from Germany the proportion was 4,013 females to every 10,000 males, as against 4,473 in 1871.</p>
			<p>Tables 29, 30, and 31 give for the year 1881 the numbers, percentage of the total population, and the proportion of sexes of persons of the various nationalities in the urban and rural parts of New South Wales.
					<span class="annotation"> [Urban and rural parts of the Colony.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The proportion of the native-born is larger in the country than in the towns. Thus, 60.72 per cent. of the urban population and 64.21 per cent. of the rural were natives of the Colony. The proportion of the native-born has increased both in the urban and rural parts since 1871, namely by 3.96 per cent. in the towns and by 3.85 per cent. in the country.
					<span class="annotation"> [Proportion of the native-born.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1881, 15.33 per cent. of the urban and 12.63 per cent. of the rural population were English-born, against 19.42 per cent. and 15.30 per cent. respectively in 1871 ; 0.38 per cent. of the urban and 0.45 per cent. of the rural population were Welsh, against 0.30 per cent. and 0.43 per cent. respectively in 1871 ; 3.35 per cent. of the urban and 3.28 per cent. of the rural population were Scotch, against 3.76 per cent. and 4.09 per cent. respectively in 1871 ; and 9.71 per cent. of the urban and 8.56 per cent. of the rural population were Irish, against 13.27 per cent. and 11.87 per cent. respectively in 1871.
					<span class="annotation"> [Proportion of persons born in Great Britain and Ireland.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The foreign-born, those born at sea, and the unspecified formed 3.83 per cent. of the total urban population, and 4.25 per cent. of the rural population, of which the Chinese contributed 1.09 per cent. in the towns and 1.72 per cent. in the country.

				</p>
			<p>While on the subject of the birth-places of the people, I shall bring this part of my Report to a close by referring to the large increase in the number of persons born in the Colony of Victoria during the decade. In 1871 the total number of Victorians in this Colony was 6,397, and in 1881 they had increased to 25,006, or 290.90 per cent. on their number. I find by the Victorian Census returns that the number of persons in that Colony born in New South Wales was 9,826 in 1881, showing that this Colony has been far more attractive to Victorians during the last decade than Victoria has been to the natives of New South Wales.

			<p>RELIGION.</p>
			<p>It was a question before the Census was taken in 1881 whether the subject of Religion should be considered or not, as it was understood that in England a determination had been arrived at to leave out the questions to be put to the inhabitants as to their religious belief, on the ground that it was inquisitorial to demand of any person a declaration on this subject. It was, however, after mature deliberation,
					<span class="annotation"> [Answers to the question as to religious belief not compulsory.] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xx"></div>
			<p>determined that the column devoted to religious persuasion should still be left in the schedules, but that it should be entirely optional on the part of the subject to answer the question or not, the collectors being particularly instructed not to press it.
					<span class="annotation"> [Answers to the question as to religious belief not compulsory.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The result of this determination was that 13,697, or 1.82 per cent. of the total population, either objected or neglected to give the information required to make this portion of the returns complete.</p>
			<p>Under the circumstances I have not classified the different returns, such as social condition or the education of the people, in connection with the various religious denominations ; but, as considerable interest had been manifested as to the education of children, I have caused to be compiled returns showing the number and proportion of children from 5 to 15 years of age of the various religious denominations who could read and write, read only, or who were unable to read or write. This part of the subject however will be treated of under the head of "Education."</p>
			<p>An attempt was made when the Census was taken to induce those people who were not averse to stating their religious persuasions to refrain from merely saying they were "Protestants" or "Catholics," but to state to what particular sect they belonged ; but notwithstanding that particular pains were taken by the majority of the collectors to obtain correct information on this subject, there were still 9,957 of the population who would merely describe themselves as "Protestants," and there were also 586 "Catholics" not otherwise described.
					<span class="annotation"> [Protestants and Catholics.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the 751,468 persons returned in 1881, 516,512 or 68.73 per cent. of the population belonged to the avrious Protestant Churches, 207,606 or 27.63 per cent. were returned as Catholics, 3,266 or 0.44 per cent. as Hebrews, 1,042 or 0.14 per cent. as belonging to "other persuasions," and 9,345 or 1.24 per cent. as Pagans. In addition to these numbers, 13,697 persons or 1.82 per cent. of the population omitted or refused to supply the information.
					<span class="annotation"> [Division of the population. Comparison with 1871.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 the Protestants numbered 339,392, or 67.34 per cent. of the population ; the Catholics, 147,627, or 29.29 per cent. ; the Hebrews, 2,395 or 0.48 per cent. ; Pagans, 7,455, or 1.48 per cent. ; and those who omitted or refused to supply the information, 5,946, or 1.18 per cent. of the population.</p>
			<p>The addition to the numbers in the decade was 177,120, or 52.18 per cent., for the Protestants ; 59,979, or 40.62 per cent., for the Catholics ; 871, or 36.36 per cent., for the Hebrews ; and 1,890, or 25.35 per cent., for the Pagans, who were mostly Chinese.
					<span class="annotation"> [Increase in the decennial period.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1881, of those embodied under the head of Protestants, 342,359, or 45.50 per cent. of the population belonged to the Church of England ; 4,836, or 0.65 per cent., were Lutherans ; 72,545, or 9.66 per cent., were Presbyterians ; 57,049, or 7.60 per cent., were Wesleyans ; 7,303, or 0.98 per cent., were described as other Methodists ; 14,328, or 1.91 per cent., were Congregationalists ; 7,307, or 0.98 per cent., were Baptists ; 828, or 0.12 per cent., were Unitarians ; and 9,957, or 1.33 per cent., were described as other Protestants.
					<span class="annotation"> ["Protestants." Comparison with 1871.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871, 229,243 persons, or 45.49 per cent. of the population, belonged to the Church of England ; 49,122, or 9.75 per cent., were returned as Presbyterians ; 36,275, or 7.20 per cent., as Wesleyan Methodists ; 3,291, or 0.65 per cent., as other Methodists ; 9,253, or 1.83 per cent., as Congregationalists ; 4,151, or 0.82 per cent., as Baptists ; 849, or 0.17 per cent., as Unitarians ; and 7,208, or 1.43 per cent., were returned under the general head of other Protestants and Protestants undescribed. Amongst those simply described as other Protestants were the Lutherans, who were not enumerated separately in 1871.</p>
			<p>The greatest increase in the decade is shown under the head of those described as other Methodists, whose numbers increased by 4,012, or 121.90 per cent. After them come the Baptists, with a numerical increase of 3,156, or 76.03 per cent. ; then the Wesleyans, with 20,774, or 57.26 per cent. ; the Congregationalists, with 5,075, or 54.84 per cent. ; the Church of England, with 113,116, or 49.34 per cent. ; and the Presbyterians, with 23,423, or 47.68 per cent.
					<span class="annotation"> [Progress in the decennial period.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The Unitarians show a numerical decrease during the decennial period of 21, or 2.47 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>Of the 207,606 persons in 1881 returned as Catholics, 207,020, or 27.55 per cent. of the population, were Roman Catholics ; only 586, or 0.08 per cent., gave themselves as Catholics without further explanation.
					<span class="annotation"> ["Catholics." Comparison with 1871.] </span>

			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxi"></div>
			<p>In 1871, 145,932, or 28.95 per cent. of the population, were Roman Catholics ; and 1,695, or 0.34 per cent., were returned as " Catholics undescribed. "</p>
			<p>We have therefore in the decade an increase of the number of Roman Catholics of 61,088, or 41.86 per cent. of their number, and a decrease in the number of Catholics undescribed of 1,109, or 65.42 per cent.</p>

			<p>Table 35, 36, and 37 relate to the numbers, percentage, and proportion of sexes in the urban and rural parts of the Colony, as regards the different religious denominations, at the Censuses of 1871 and 1881.
					<span class="annotation"> [Urban and rural parts of the Colony.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 there was no table prepared of the numbers of persons of the various religious persuasions for the urban and rural parts of the Colony, so that there was no check upon the tables relating to the percentage and proportion of sexes in the towns and in the country. In 1881, however, a table showing the numbers in these divisions of the Colony is given, to facilitate the work of proving the accuracy of the other tables, if it be thought necessary to check the calculations.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxii"></div>
			<p>These table show that in 1881, for every 10,000 of the urban population 6,913 were classed under the head of " Protestants, " 2,710 under the head of " Catholics, " sixty-five were " Hebrews, " and ninety-seven were " Pagans, " leaving a balance of 215 belonging to other persuasions and to persuasions unspecified. In 1871, of every 10,000 of the urban population, 6,923 were classed as " Protestants, " 2,794 were " Catholics, " ninety-one were " Hebrews, " and forty-eight were " Pagans, " leaving 144 belonging to unspecified persuasions.</p>
			<p>Of every 10,000 of the rural population it will be seen that, in 1881, 6,821 were Protestants, 2,846 Catholics, fifteen Hebrews, and 162 were Pagans, leaving 156 unspecified. In 1871 the numbers were, for every 10,000 of the rural population, 6,558 Protestants, 3,062 Catholics, ten Hebrews, 235 Pagans, and 135 unspecified.</p>
			<p>The percentage of the Protestant population is nearly equal in town and country, the difference being slightly in favour of the towns. The Catholics, on the other hand, show a preponderance in the country parts. The Hebrews have a larger percentage in urban than in the rural districts, while the Pagans—principally Chinese—show a much larger percentage in the rural parts than in the towns, being mostly located on the gold-fields.</p>
			<p>It will be seen that during the decade, in the urban parts of the Colony, the Protestant population has decreased by ten in every 10,000 persons, and the Catholics have decreased by eighty-four in every 10,000 of their number. In the rural districts, during the same period, the Protestants have increased by 263 in every 10,000, while the Catholics have decreased by 216 in every 10,000 of their number.</p>
			<p>EDUCATION.</p>
			<p>The next part of my Report will refer to the important subject of Education, and the results obtained from the facts gathered at the last Census will be found to be of a most interesting character.
					<span class="annotation"> [Importance of the subject of education.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The very greatest care was taken with this branch of the information gathered by the Census collectors; and, in order that the educational status of the people should not be made to appear to be too far advanced in the aggregate, it was determined after serious consideration that all children under five years of age should be put down as being unable to read or write. This course was adopted in order that we may be sure the standard of education is even higher than the figures show it to be.
					<span class="annotation"> [All children under five years of age classed amongst the uneducated.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>These returns of course only apply to the degree of primary education of the people, and will be found valuable as supplementing the statistics issued by the Minister of Public Instruction.</p>
			<p>Up to 30 years of age the items are tabulated in quinquennial periods; from 30 to 50 in decennial periods, and all persons of 50 years of age and upwards are grouped together.
					<span class="annotation"> [Grouping of ages.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The year 20-21 is given separately, in order that the distinction might be made between those who were under and over the legal age of majority.</p>
			<p>Of the total population in 1881, there were 507,067 persons who could read and write, 49,372 who could read only, and 195,029 who were unable to read or write.
					<span class="annotation"> [Numbers in 1881 who could read and write, read only, or could neither read nor write.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Deducting the children under 5 years of age, we have a total of 640,345 persons. This will enable us to arrive at a proper estimate of our standard of education, and shows that 79.39 per cent. of that number could read and write, 7.73 per cent. could read only, and 12.88 per cent. could neither read nor write.</p>
			<p>This shows a great improvement since 1871, the percentage of those of 5 years and upwards who could read and write being 70.33 per cent. ; 12.94 per cent. could read only, and 16.73 per cent. were unable to read or write.</p>
			<p>Of the male population of 5 years of age and upwards, 280,344, or 79.38 per cent., could read and write; 24,145, or 6.84 per cent., could read only; and 48,703, or 13.78 per cent., could neither read nor write.</p>
			<p>In 1871, 70.77 per cent. of the male population of 5 years of age and over could read and write, 11.33 per cent. could read only, and 17.90 per cent. were unable to read or write.</p>
			<p>Of the female population of 5 years of age and over in 1881, 226, 236, or 79.41 per cent., could read and write; 25,149, or 8.84 per cent., could only read; and 33,472, or 11.75 per cent., could not read or write.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxiii"></div>
			<p>In 1871, 69.78 per cent. of the female population of the same age could read and write, 14.94 per cent. could only read, and 15.28 per cent. could neither read nor write.</p>
			<p>It will be seen by the above figures that the educational status of the male and female population is nearly equal, there being a difference of 0.03 per cent. of those who could read and write in favour of the females. Of those who could read only there were 2.00 per cent. more females than males, while of those who could neither read nor write there were 2.03 per cent. more males than females; but it must be borne in mind that amongst the totally uneducated the Chinese population is included in the calculations for the males, whereby the proportion of the illiterate is considerably augmented.</p>
			<p>Tables 43, 44, and 45 have been prepared to show the distribution of the population as regards education, inclusively and exclusively of the Chinese and aborigines, who are counted amongst the settled population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Chinese and settled aborigines excluded.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Discarding the Chinese and aboriginal element, we have a total population of all specified ages over 5 years of 620,107 persons, of whom 506,365, or 80.75 per cent., could read and write in 1881; 49,266, or 7.85 per cent., who could read only; and 71,476, or 11.40 per cent., who could neither read nor write.</p>
			<p>This shows a very great improvement on the year 1871, when the percentage of those who could read and write was 71.64, of those who could read only 13.17 per cent., and of those who were unable to read or write 15.19 per cent.</p>
			<p>Taking the proportion of sexes, we have for the males 280,251, or 81.74 per cent., who could read and write; 24,119, or 7.03 per cent. who could read only; and 38,498, or 11.23 per cent., who could neither read nor write. For the females we have 226,114, or 79.55 per cent., who could read and write; 25,147, or 8.85 per cent., who could read only; and 32,978, or 11.60 per cent., who could neither read nor write.</p>
			<p>In 1871, of the males there were 73.13 per cent. who could read and write, 11.68 per cent. who could read only, and 15.19 per cent. who were unable to read or write. Of the females there were 69.85 per cent. who could read and write, 14.96 per cent. who could read only, and 15.19 per cent. who could neither read nor write.</p>
			<p>The educational status of the people is therefore largely improved in 1881, there being 8.61 per cent. more males and 9.70 more females who could read and write than in 1871. Of those who could read only there were 4.65 per cent. more males and 6.11 per cent. more females in 1871 than in 1881, while of those who could neither read nor write there were 3.86 per cent. more males and 3.59 more females in 1871 than in 1881.</p>
			<p>At the educable age—that is, between 5 and 15 years—the population numbers 187,230, of whom 121,596, or 64.94 per cent., could read and write; 25,049, or 13.38 per cent., could read only; and 40,585, or 21.68 per cent., could neither read nor write.
					<span class="annotation"> [Educable age, 5 to 15 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 at those ages 53.60 per cent. could read and write, 20.96 could read only, and 25.44 per cent. could do neither.</p>
			<p>Of the males at these ages in 1881, 60845, or 64.18 per cent. could read and write, 12,928, or 13.64 per cent., could read, and 21,028, or 22.18 per cent., were unable to read or write. Of the females, 60,751, or 65.73 per cent., could read and write, 12,121, or 13.11 per cent., could read only, and 19,557, or 21.16 per cent., could neither read nor write.</p>
			<p>By these figures it will be seen that the percentage of children of the educable age who could read and write was 1.55 per cent. in favour of the females.</p>
			<p>In 1871, of the males of these ages, 52.39 per cent. could read and write, 21.42 per cent. could read only, and 26.19 per cent. were unable to read or write. Of the females at the same period, 54.84 per cent. could read and write, 20.49 per cent. could read only, and 24.67 could neither read nor write.</p>
			<p>This shows an improvement during the decade in the educational status of children of the educable age, of 11.79 per cent. males, and 10.89 per cent. females who could read and write.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxiv"></div>
			<p>Referring to the tables which deal with the occupations of the people, it will be seen that there were 154,885 persons returned as scholars under tuition either at home or at school, and it may be presumed that the majority of them were able to read and write. Of these, 77,821 are males and 77,064 females.

			<p>This leaves us with a balance of population, between 5 and 15 years of age, of 32,612, namely, 17,127 males and 15,485 females, who were not receiving any education. Many of these are employed in assisting in agricultural pursuits, &amp;c., some as apprentices to trades, and the remainder are at home unemployed. The numbers cannot be given, as the occupations were not classed according to ages; but it is gratifying to know that the number of children between five and fifteen years of age who are not being educated is less by 4,816 than in 1871, notwithstanding that the population during the decade had increased by nearly 50 per cent. It is also very satisfactory to show that 82.61 per cent. of the children at the educable ages are receiving instruction either at school or at home. In 1871, 70.79 per cent. at those ages were receiving tuition, which was at that time considered a very favourable state of things; but the large increase in the percentage during the decade has raised the Colony in this respect to a position which will compare favourably with that of any other portion of the British dominions.</p>
			<p>In many instances children of a very tender age up to five years were put down as being able to read and write; but in order that the returns should not be questioned as to their accuracy, it was deemed advisable to return all children under five years of age as being unable to read or write. It is therefore certain that the educational status of the Colony has been set down at something below its actual state of efficiency.
					<span class="annotation"> [Children under five years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The population of the age of fifteen years and upwards (still excluding Chinese and settled aborigines) numbered, in 1881, 439,877 persons, of whom 384,769 or 87.47 per cent. could read and write, 24,217 or 5.51 per cent. could read only, and 30,891 or 7.02 per cent. could neither read nor write; and taking the sexes separately, we have for the males 219,406 or 88.45 per cent. who could read and write; 11,191 or 4.51 per cent. who could read only; and 17,470, or 7.04 per cent. who were unable to read; and for the females, 165,363 or 86.21 per cent. who could read and write, 13,026 or 6.79 per cent. who could read only, and 13.421 or 7.00 per cent. who could not read.
					<span class="annotation"> [Adults fifteen years and upwards.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871, of the population of fifteen years of age and upwards (exclusive of Chinese and aborigines) 79.76 per cent. could read and write. This shows an improvement for 1881 of 7.71 per cent. Of the males in 1871, 81.52 per cent. could read and write, showing an improvement for 1881 of 6.93 per cent.; and of the females in 1871, 77.49 per cent. could read and write, showing an improvement for 1881 of 8.72 per cent.</p>
			<p>By the above figures it will be seen that in 1881 the percentage of those of fifteen years of age and upwards who could read and write was 2.24 per cent. in favour of the males. Up to the age of fifteen years the females are in advance of the males in point of education, but over that age the males have the advantage. This may be accounted for by the fact that as a rule the male population continue their studies after the school age to a much greater extent than the females.</p>

					<span class="annotation"> [Further comparisons.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Leaving out all children under 5 years of age, we find that the number of those who could read and write increased in the decennial period by 71.09 per cent. For the males the increase was 69.92 per cent., and for the females 72.56 per cent. ; the numbers of those who could read only decreased by 9.51 per cent., or 8.59 per cent. for the males and 10.38 per cent. for the females; and of those who could neither read nor write the increase was 16.69 per cent., namely, 16.71 per cent. for the males, and 16.65 per cent. for the females.
					<span class="annotation"> [All specified ages, 5 years and upwards.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>For the previous decade, namely, between 1861 and 1871, the increase of the numbers of those who could read and write was 57.25 per cent., or 49.51 per cent. for the males and 68.22 per cent. for the females; of the numbers of those who could read only the increase was 18.49 per cent., or 21.23 per cent. for the males and 16.03 per cent. for the females; and of those who were unable to read the increase was 30.02 per cent., or 31.16 per cent. for the males and 28.38 per cent. for the females.</p>

			<p>At the educable ages the improvement in the education of children is highly satisfactory.

Between the ages of 10 and 15 years the progress was exceedingly marked, inasmuch as the increase to the numbers of those who could read and write between those ages was 88.04 per cent., or 86.82 per cent. for the males and 89.29 per cent. for the females. Of the numbers of those between 5 and 10 years of age who could read only the increase was 19.82 per cent., or 20.02 per cent. for the males and 19.61 per cent. for the females. Of the numbers between 10 and 15 who could read only the increase was only 6.14 per cent., or 6.55 per cent. for the males and 5.73 per cent. for the females. Of those who were unable to read or write between the ages of 5 and 10 years the increase was 36.05 per cent., or 36.45 per cent. for the males and 35.64 per cent. for the females. Between the ages of 10 and 15 years the increase in the numbers of those who could not read was exceedingly small, being only 5.82 per cent., or 6.63 per cent. for the males and 4.98 per cent. for the females.

			<p>In 1881 the excess of those who could read and write in the urban over the rural parts was only 510 in every 10,000 persons at the age 5 to 15 years, and only 362 in every 10,000 at the age of 15 and upwards.</p>
			<p>Thus it will be seen that there has been an improvement in the educational status of the rural parts of the Colony during the decade of 1,720 persons (in every 10,000) who could read and write between the ages of 5 and 15 years, and of 905 in every 10,000 of 15 years of age and upwards.</p>
			<p>In Sydney and suburbs the standard of primary education is, on account of the greater facilities afforded to children, naturally higher than in other parts of the Colony, although the difference is decreasing every year as facilities are multiplied in the country districts.

			<p>The above shows the steady improvement which has been maintained during the decade at every age, and it is not any presumption to reiterate that Primary Education in New South Wales will compare favourably with that of most parts of the British Dominions.</p>
			<p>EDUCATION OF CHILDREN OF VARIOUS RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS.</p>
			<p>As an addition to the general subject of Education, the Compiler has prepared returns showing the numbers and percentage of children belonging to the various religious denominations who could read and write, read only, or who were unable to read or write. In these returns children of 15 years of age have been included, while on all previous returns the line was drawn at children under 15 years.
					<span class="annotation"> [Children of 15 years of age included.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The total number of children up to 15 years of age inclusive was 310,455; of this number, 111,123 were under 5 years of age, who it was assumed could neither read nor write. We have, therefore, 199,332 children of the various religious denominations of 5 to 15 years of age inclusive. Of this number, 100,983 were males, and 99,349 females.
					<span class="annotation"> [Children 5 to 15 years inclusive.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the total number of children at the above ages, 132,680 or 66.58 per cent. could read and write, 26,996 or 13.54 per cent. could read only, and 39,656 or 19.88 per cent. could neither read nor write.</p>
			<p>Of the boys, 66,039 or 65.40 per cent. could read and write, 13,985 or 13.85 per cent. could read only; and 20,956 or 20.75 per cent. were unable to read or write.
					<span class="annotation"> [Boys.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Or the girls, 66,641 or 67.76 per cent. could read and write, 13,011 or 13.23 per cent. could read only; and 18,697 or 19.01 per cent. were unable to read.
					<span class="annotation"> [Girls.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>It will be seen, therefore, that of the total number of children between the ages of 5 and 15 years inclusive, that the girls stood higher than the boys by 2.36 per cent. of those who could read and write.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxx"></div>
			<p>Of the total number of children of the above ages, 91,872 or 46.09 per cent. belonged to the Church of England ; 19,501 or 9.78 per cent. were Presbyterians ; 17,635 or 8.84 per cent. Wesleyans ; 2,368 or 1.19 per cent. other Methodists ; 4,257 or 2.13 per cent. Congregationalists; 2,073 or 1.04 per cent. Baptists ; 135 or 0.07 per cent. Unitarians ; 2,634 or 1.34 per cent. other Protestants ; 55,5546 or 27.86 per cent. Roman Catholics ; 857 or 0.43 per cent. Hebrews ; and 2,454 or 1.23 per cent. belonged to other and unspecified persuasions.
					<span class="annotation"> [Denominations.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Reference to tables 46 and 47 will show that the children belonging to the Unitarian and Hebrew bodies rank highest in the scale of primary education. Of the Unitarians, 79.26 per cent. of their number could read and write, 5.18 per cent. could read only, and 15.56 per cent. could neither read nor write. Of the Hebrews, 77.01 per cent. of their number could read and write, 6.89 per cent. could read only, and 16.10 per cent. were unable to read or write. It would, however, be misleading to place too much stress upon the apparent high standard of the children of these two denominations, inasmuch as the numbers of Hebrew and Unitarian denominations are so small that the addition of two or three children very largely alters the percentages.
					<span class="annotation"> [Hebrews and Unitarians.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the more prominent recognized religious bodies the children of the Congregationalists stand the highest; the others come in the following order:— Baptists, Wesleyan Methodists, other Methodists, Presbyterians, Church of England, other Protestants, and Roman Catholics.
					<span class="annotation"> [Other denominations.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In every thousand children of the various religious denominations, the numbers of those who could read and write, read only, or who were unable to read and write were as follows, respectively :— Congregationalists, 743,92,165 ; Baptists, 712, 123, 165 ; Wesleyan Methodists, 708, 113, 179 ; other Methodists, 684, 135, 181 ; Presbyterians, 682, 139, 179 ; Church of England, 658, 135, 207 ; Roman Catholics, 652, 148, and 200.</p>
			<p>The following table shows the Educational Status of the boys and girls of each denomination separately :—</p>

			<p>SOCIAL OR CONJUGAL CONDITION.</p>
			<p>The next subject to be dealt with in the Report is the social or conjugal condition of the people.</p>
			<p>I mentioned in my Report on the Census of 1871 that, in my analysis of the statistical information under this head, I was unable, through an oversight in the compilation of the returns for 1861, to compare the two periods as far as the classification by ages was concerned, and that general results could only be given.
					<span class="annotation"> [Difficulty of comparing the two periods 1861 and 1871.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>I am, however, in a position to compare 1871 with 1881 in all their details, and will proceed to do so.
					<span class="annotation"> [Difficulty removed in respect to 1871 and 1881.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>As in 1871, the Chinese element is included in all the computations referring to the conjugal condition of the people, by which the percentage of the married is weakened; but as there is a considerable settled population of Chinese in different parts of the Colony engaged in various pursuits, commercial, mechanical, and agricultural, and as numbers of marriages have taken place and are continually occurring between them and European women, it is absolutely necessary that they should be considered as a part of our settled population, and be included in the conjugal computations.
					<span class="annotation"> [Chinese included in the returns.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>We will now proceed to compare the general results of the Census of 1881 with those of the two preceding ones.</p>
			<p>The figures given relate to the whole specified population.</p>
			<p>In 1881, of the total population of 751,468 there were<div class="footnote">* 
					<p>Including unspecified, who were chiefly Chinese, and who may therefore be reasonably included amongst the unmarried.</p>
				</div>507,415 or 67.52 per cent. unmarried, 218,051 or 29.02 per cent. married, and 26,002 or 3.46 per cent. widowed.
					<span class="annotation"> [General results of the Census of 1881 compared with those of 1871 and 1861.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 there were 336,770 persons or 66.82 per cent. of the population unmarried, 150,692 or 29.90 per cent. married, and 16,519 or 3.28 per cent. widowed.</p>
			<p>In 1861 there were 231,152 persons or 65.88 per cent. unmarried, 109,188 or 31.12 per cent. married, and 10,520 or 3.00 per cent. widowed.</p>
			<p>The unmarried therefore increased in the last decade by 170,645 per cent., or 50.67 per cent. of their numbers, the married by 67,359, or 44.70 per cent., and the widows by 9,483, or 57.40 per cent.</p>
			<p>In the previous decade the unmarried had increased by 45.69 per cent. of their numbers, the married by 38.01 per cent., and the widowed by 57.02 per cent.</p>
			<p>So that it will be seen the proportionate increase of the unmarried was 4.98 per cent. greater in the last decennial period than in the previous decade. The proportionate increase of the married was, however, 6.69 per cent. greater than in the previous ten years, while for the widowed there was only a difference of 0.38 per cent.</p>
			<p>Leaving out for the males all under 20 years of age, and for the females all under 15 years, and dealing with the adult population only, we are left with a total unmarried population numbering 104,486 in 1871, and 168,029 in 1881, and with a percentage of the total population 20.73 in 1871, and 22.36 per cent. in 1881, or an increase of 1.63 per cent. in the decade.
					<span class="annotation"> [Increase in the proportion of the unmarried, taking the adult population only.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the 218,052 persons returned as married in 1881, 110,218 were males and 107,834 were females, so that there were 2,384 husbands whose wives did not reside in the Colony when the Census was taken.
					<span class="annotation"> [Married—proportion of sexes.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 there were 75,810 husbands and 74,882 wives, the excess of husbands being 928 only. The additional excess in 1881 may be accounted for by the attraction of the Colony, in the latter part of the decade, to persons interested in mining pursuits. No doubt most of the husbands would be joined by their wives and families as soon as homes had been provided for them.</p>
			<p>In England, on the contrary, the number of wives always predominates, there being generally about 2 per cent. of the total number of husbands absent, most of whom are seamen.</p>
			<p>In the period of 1871-1881 there was an addition to our married population of 34,408, or 45.39 per cent. to the males, and 32,951, or 44.00 per cent. to the females.
					<span class="annotation"> [Increase of the married population.] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxxii"></div>
			<p>The increase in the period 1861-71 was only 34.36 per cent. to the males, and 39.94 per cent. to the females.</p>
			<p>Here it will be seen that the increase to our married population in the last decennial period exceeded that of the previous decade by no less than 11.03 per cent. for the males, and 4.06 per cent. for the females.</p>
			<p>The widowed persons in 1881 were 9,938 males and 16,064 females. In 1871 there were 6,730 widowers and 9,789 widows; so that of the widowed population the females exceeded the males in 1871 by 3,059, and in 1881 by 6,126.
					<span class="annotation"> [Widowed—proportion of sexes.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The increase in the decennial period was 3,208, or 47.67 per cent. to the number of widowers, and 6,275, or 64.10 per cent to the number of widows.</p>
			<p>The proportion of the married to the widowed was, in 1871, 1,126 husbands to 100 widowers, and 765 wives to 100 widows, and in 1881, 1,109 husbands to 100 widowers, and 671 wives to 100 widows. In England the proportion is about 500 wives to 100 widows. It will be seen that our proportion is gradually approaching that of England, as the Colony becomes more settled.
					<span class="annotation"> [Proportion of the married to the widowed.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Taking the people at different ages, we have the following results for the married portion of the population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Married population at different ages.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between 15 and 20 years there were in 1881 2,257 persons, namely, 127 males and 2,130 females married, as against 71 males and 1,479 females in 1871. The increase of the married at these ages was therefore 707, or 45.61 per cent., being 56, or 78.87 per cent. for the males, and 651, or 44.02 per cent. for the females.
					<span class="annotation"> [15-20 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between 20 and 21 in 1881, there were 2,183 persons—281 males and 1,902 females married, as against 1,434 persons—145 males and 1,289 females in 1871, the increase being 749 persons, or 52.23 per cent., namely, 136 males, or 93.79 per cent., and 613 females, or 47.66 per cent.
					<span class="annotation"> [20-21 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between 21 and 25 years the numbers were in 1881 18,388 persons—5,323 males and 13,065 females, as against 11,508 persons—3,148 males and 8,360 females in 1871, showing an increase in the decade of 6,880 persons, or 59.78 per cent., being 2,175 or 69.09 per cent. males and 4,705 or 56.28 per cent. females.
					<span class="annotation"> [21-25 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between 25 and 30 in 1881 there were 33,083 married persons—14,445 males and 18,638 females, as against 24,590 persons—10,066 males and 14,524 females, in 1871. The increase in the decennial period was therefore 8,493 persons, or 34.54 per cent., namely, 4,379 or 43.50 per cent. males and 4,114 or 28.33 per cent. females.
					<span class="annotation"> [25-30 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between 30 and 35 the numbers in 1881 were 34,391 persons—16,828 males and 17,563 females. In 1871 there were 25,424 persons— 12,533 males and 12,891 females, showing an increase of 8,967 persons, or 35.27 per cent., being 4295 or 34.27 per cent. to the males and 4,672 or 36.24 per cent. to the females.
					<span class="annotation"> [30-35 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between the ages of 35 and 40 there were 33,915 persons—17,798 males and 16,117 females in 1881, as against 23,876 persons in 1871, namely, 12,711 males and 11,165 females, the increase being 10,039 or 42.05 per cent.—5,087, or 40.02 per cent. males, and 4,952 or 44.35 per cent. females.
					<span class="annotation"> [35-40 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between 40 and 50 there were in 1881 50,515 persons married—28,414 males and 22,101 females. In 1871 there were 31,637 persons—17,938 males and 13,699 females. The increase was therefore 18,878 or 59.67 per cent., being 10,476 or 58.40 per cent. males and 8,402 or 61.33 per cent. females.
					<span class="annotation"> [40-50 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between the ages of 50 and 60 at the last Census the number of married persons was 26,091, namely, 15,752 males and 10,339 females, as against 19,822 persons in 1871—11,855 males and 7,967 females. The increase therefore was 6,269 or 31.63 per cent. persons, consisting of 3,897 or 32.87 per cent. males and 2,372 or 29.77 per cent. females.
					<span class="annotation"> [50-60 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between 60 and 70 years there were in 1881 12,608 married persons—8,037 males and 4,571 females, as against 8,216 persons—5,425 males and 2,791 females in 1871, showing an increase of 4,392 or 53.46 per cent. persons, comprising 2,612 or 48.15 per cent. males and 1,780 or 63.77 per cent. females.
					<span class="annotation"> [60-70 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Between 70 and 80 in 1881 the numbers were 3,689 married persons—2,578 males and 1,111 females, as against 2,151 persons in 1871—1,603 males and 548 females. The increase in the decade was therefore 1,538 or 71.50 per cent. persons—975 or 60.70 per cent. males and 563 or 102.74 per cent. females.
					<span class="annotation"> [70-80 years.] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxxiii"></div>
			<p>At the age of 80 years and upwards the number of married persons in 1881 was 576—namely, 456 males and 120 females. In 1871 there were 282 persons married, consisting of 207 males and 75 females. The increase in the decennial period was therefore 294 or 104.25 per cent.—namely, 249 or 120.28 per cent. males and 45 or 60.00 per cent. females.
					<span class="annotation"> [80 years and upwards.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>A careful study of the above figures will be very interesting; they show that up to the age of 25 years the increase on the percentage of married persons is very large ; that between the ages of 25 and 40 the increase falls off ; and again, from 40 upwards (excepting between 50 and 60) the increase in the percentage rises again in an extraordinary manner.</p>
			<p>The following is a summary of the proportion of sexes of the three social classes in the years 1861, 1871, and 1881:—

			<p>So that there were, in 1861, 7,112 unmarried females to every 10,000 unmarried males. Of the married, there were 9,611 females to every 10,000 males; and of the widowed there were 12,002 females to every 10,000 males. In 1871 the unmarried were in the proportion of 7,467 females to every 10,000 males ; the married, 9,879 females to every 10,000 males; and the widowed, 14,545 females to every 10,000 males. In 1881, of the unmarried there were 7,461 females to every 10,000 males ; of the married, there were 9,786 females to every 10,000 males, and of the widowed, there were 16,164 females to every 10,000 males.</p>
			<p>The very large preponderance of widows over widowers is to a great extent accounted for by the fact that a large proportion of marriages are contracted between men well advanced in years and comparatively young women, and in the course of nature the husbands in such cases are necessarily the first to pass away and leave their widows behind.

			<p>Referring to the returns for 1881, we find that of the unmarried, numbering 540,810 persons, 298,612 were under the age of 15 years, and 206,198 were 15 years and upwards.
					<span class="annotation"> [Returns for 1881—unmarried.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the 298,612 persons under 15 years of age, 151,117 or 50.63 per cent. were males, and 147,495 or 49.37 per cent. females. Of the 206,198 persons aged 15 years and upwards, 137,992 or 66.92 per cent. were males, and 68,206 or 33.08 per cent. were females. Under the age of 15 years there were 9,760 unmarried females to every 10,000 unmarried males ; above that age, there were only 4,943 unmarried females to every 10,000 unmarried males.
					<span class="annotation"> [Proportion of sexes.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 there were 9,714 unmarried females to every 10,000 unmarried males under 15 years of age, and above that age, 4,690 unmarried females to every 10,000 unmarried males, by which it will be seen that there has been some slight improvement during the decade towards the equalization of the sexes, namely, by 46 in 10,000 under the age of 15, and by 253 in 10,000 above that age.</p>
			<p>Deducting the males under 20 years of age and the females under 15, we have in New South Wales 100,005 bachelors and 68,206 spinsters, or a proportion of 6,820 spinsters to every 10,000 bachelors.
					<span class="annotation"> [Bachelors and spinsters.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871 the numbers of bachelors and spinsters of the above ages were respectively 64,620 and 39,955, or a proportion of 6,183 spinsters to every 10,000 bachelors. During the decennial period the improvement towards the equalization of sexes was 637 spinsters in every 10,000.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxxiv"></div>
			<p>Taking the unmarried, we find that the proportion of females to males decreases with age, as will be seen by the following :—</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Under 15 years there are 976 spinsters to every 1,000 bachelors.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Between 15 and 20 there are 931 spinsters to every 1,000 bachelors.</p>

					<p>Between 70 and 80 there are 102 spinsters to every 1,000 bachelors.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>At 80 and upwards there are 95 spinsters to every 1,000 bachelors.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of the married, there were in 1881 218,044 persons aged 15 years and upwards, and 8 only under 15 years of age. Of the former number, 110,218 were males and 107,834 were females. Between 15 and 20 years there were 127 married males and 2,130 married females. At the age 20-21 there were 281 married males and 19,902 married females. Above that age the proportion of married females to married males goes on decreasing, as is shown by the following :—
					<span class="annotation"> [Husbands and wives.] </span>

				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of the widowed there are 18 females returned between the ages of 15 and 20 years.
					<span class="annotation"> [Widowers and widows.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The following shows the proportion of widows to widowers from 20 years upwards, by which it will be seen that such proportion decreases with age.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, between 20 and 21 the proportion is 7667 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, between 21 and 25 the proportion is 2300 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, between 25 and 30 the proportion is 1960 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, between 30 and 35 the proportion is 1995 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, between 35 and 40 the proportion is 1809 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, between 40 and 50 the proportion is 1787 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, between 50 and 60 the proportion is 1658 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, between 60 and 70 the proportion is 1614 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, between 70 and 80 the proportion is 1263 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>At 80 years and upwards proportion is 953 widows to 1000 widowers.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Taking the two decennial periods 1861-71 and 1871-81, the comparative differences of the unmarried and married at various ages are not of sufficient significance to call for special comment; but of the widowed the proportions in the two periods vary so greatly that it will be interesting to compare the figures for 1871 given below with those for 1881.</p>
			<p>In 1871 the proportion of widows and widowers</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>between 20 and 21 years was 7000 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>between 21 and 25 years was 5217 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>between 25 and 30 years was 3399 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>between 30 and 35 years was 2214 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>between 35 and 40 years was 1950 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>between 40 and 50 years was 1696 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>between 50 and 60 years was 1494 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>between 60 and 70 years was 1145 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>between 70 and 80 years was 928 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>80 years and upwards years was 903 widows to 1000 widowers</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By which it will be seen that between the ages of 20 and 21 there were 667 less widows to every 1,000 widowers in 1871 than in 1881.</p>
			<p>Between 21 and 25 there were 2,917 more widows to every 1,000 widowers in 1871 than in 1881.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxxv"></div>
			<p>Between 25 and 30 there were 1,439 more widows to every 1,000 widowers in 1871 than in 1881.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Between 30 and 35 there were 216 more</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Between 35 and 40 there were 141 more</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Between 40 and 50 there were 91 less</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Between 50 and 60 there were 164 less</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Between 60 and 70 there were 469 less</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Between 70 and 80 there were 335 less</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>and at 80 and upwards there were 50 less</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Widows to every 1,000 widowers in 1871 than in 1881.</p>
			<p>Thus it will be seen that the proportion of widows to widowers up to the age of 40 years was much greater in 1871 than in 1881, and that above that age the proportion was less.</p>
			<p>These figures prove, as preceding ones have done, that females as a rule marry at a much younger age than males, and become widowed much earlier in life.</p>
			<p>Having analyzed and compared the social and conjugal condition of the people in the two decennial periods 1861-71 and 1871-81, we find that the whole population of the Colony in 1881 was therefore distributed as follows :—

			<p>Tables numbers 53 and 54 give at three periods of age the number and percentage of the unmarried, married, and widowed, in Sydney and suburbs, in towns and villages, and in the rural parts of the Colony. In Sydney and suburbs there were, in 1881, 142,499 persons of all ages or 63.56 per cent. unmarried, 70,917 or 31.63 per cent. married, and 10,140 or 4.52 per cent. widowed. In the towns and villages there were 145,620 or 68.56 per cent. unmarried, 59,558 or 28.04 per cent. married, and 6,454 or 3.04 per cent. widowed, making a total of the urban population of 288,119 persons or 66.06 per cent. unmarried, 130,475 or 29.84 per cent. married, and 16,594 or 3.78 per cent. widowed. In the rural parts of the Colony there were 216,691 or 68.83 per cent. unmarried, 87,577 or 27.81 per cent. married, and 9,408 or 2.99 per cent. widowed.
					<span class="annotation"> [Unmarried, married, and widowed, in the urban and rural parts of the Colony.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In 1871, of the urban population 64.15 per cent. were unmarried, 31.60 per cent. married, and 4.09 per cent. widowed. Of the rural population, 68.74 per cent. were unmarried, 28.48 per cent. married, and 2.57 per cent. widowed.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxxvi"></div>
			<p>By the foregoing figures it is shown that during the decennial period the unmarried had increased in the urban parts of the Colony by 1.91 per cent., while the married had decreased by 1.76 per cent., and the widowed by 0.31 per cent. The percentages in the rural parts remained very steady, the only difference being an increase of 0.09 per cent. in the unmarried, a decrease of 0.67 per cent. in the married, and an increase of 0.42 per cent. in the widowed portion of the population.</p>
			<p>Of the male population in the urban parts of the Colony, in 1881, 158,205 or 69.08 per cent. were unmarried, 64,191 or 28.05 per cent. were married, and 5,526 or 2.41 per cent. were widowers. In the county parts, 130,904 or 71.85 per cent. were unmarried, 46,027 or 25.26 per cent. were married, and 4,412 or 2.42 per cent. were widowers. In 1871 the percentages in the urban parts were 66.35 per cent. unmarried, 30.78 per cent. married, and 2.61 per cent. widowed. In the rural parts, 72.29 per cent. were unmarried, 25.13 per cent. married, and 2.33 per cent. widowed ; so that in the towns the unmarried increased by 2.63 per cent., while the married decreased by 2.73 per cent., and the widowed by 0.20 per cent. in the country, the unmarried had decreased by 0.44 per cent., the married had increased by 0.13 per cent., and the widowed by 0.09 per cent.</p>
			<p>Of the female population, in 1881, in the towns, &amp;c., 129,914 or 62.66 per cent. were unmarried, 66,284 or 31.92 per cent. married, and 11,068 or 5.23 per cent. widows. In the country, 85,787 or 64.67 per cent. were unmarried, 41,550 or 31.32 per cent. married, and 4,996 or 3.76 per cent. widows. In 1871, in the urban parts, 61.92 per cent. were unmarried, 32.42 per cent. married, and 5.60 per cent. widows. In the country, 63.78 per cent. were unmarried, 33.15 per cent. married, and 2.91 per cent. widows; by which it will be seen that in the urban parts of the Colony the percentage of the female population had increased by 0.74 per cent. in the unmarried, and decreased by 0.50 per cent. in the married, and 0.37 in the widows. In the country, the unmarried had increased by 0.89 per cent., the married decreased by 1.83 per cent., and the widows were increased by 0.85 per cent.</p>
			<p>OCCUPATIONS.</p>
			<p>In the compilation of that portion of the returns which has reference to the occupations of the people considerable difficulty was encountered.</p>
			<p>The greatest care was taken that the instructions issued to the enumerators should be most clear and explicit (see Appendices F and G), and the explanations printed on the Householders' Schedules were so plain that it was hoped the returns would be as nearly perfect as possible. Notwithstanding these facts, it was found on tabulating the " Occupation Forms " that the instructions issued to the enumerators had in some cases been utterly ignored, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the Schedules were reduced to anything like order. I am happy to state, however, that the majority of the enumerators were most painstaking in their work, and reduced the labour of tabulating—so far as their returns were concerned—to a minimum.
					<span class="annotation"> [Instructions to enumerators.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>As pointed out in my Report on the Census returns of 1871, it was only possible to indicate one occupation to each individual, although some persons followed two and sometimes several occupations. For instance, a merchant might at the same time be a grazier and a land proprietor; an innkeeper might also be a storekeeper and a farmer—in fact, numerous individuals follow more than one occupation at different times of the year; and it was therefore determined to overcome the difficulty by enumerating only the principal occupation of each person followed on the day upon which the Census was taken, namely, on the 3rd April, 1881. This plan will at least sufficiently illustrate the various pursuits of the people, and enable us to compare the results with those of the previous Census taken in 1871.
					<span class="annotation"> [Persons following two or more occupations.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Considerable difficulty was experienced by the tabulators in determining from the schedules whether a person was a master or a servant, in the absence of the necessary information being given, and they had in many instances to be guided in their opinion by the surrounding circumstances; but I have every reason to believe that the tabulation was more than ordinarily accurate, considering the arduous task it was to subdivide the labour. These remarks apply more particularly to the trading and agricultural classes.
					<span class="annotation"> [Difficulties in the sub-division of labour.] </span>
				</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxxvii"></div>
			<p>Again, in the cases of publicans, innkeepers, and the keepers of houses of entertainment, it was often found difficult to determine who was the employer and who the employed ; it was therefore necessary to class them all under the head of " Employed in the production and distribution of food, drink, &amp;c. "</p>
			<p>In 1871, the classification of labour amongst females was somewhat different to that which was adopted at the last Census. In the former period, all females who were not clearly stated to be in any of the trades of other occupations, and whether employed in house-work or not, were classed under one head of " Domestic Duties "; while hired domestic servants were classed under the head of " Unskilled Labour. " In the present returns, in Class V, " Domestic, " there are, as in 1871, three sub-classes, but in sub-class 1 there are four sections. No. 1 includes all persons engaged in " Domestic Duties " ; No. 2, " Hired Domestic Servants " ; No. 3, " Infants and Children not attending School " ; and No. 4, " Midwives, Nurses, " &amp;c.
					<span class="annotation"> [Alteration in certain classifications.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>It was intended to have extended the information respecting the occupations of the people by giving the number of persons of each sex in every occupation at different periods of age; but the calamitous fire at the Garden Palace rendered it impossible to carry this project into effect, as the whole of the papers bearing upon this subject—with the exception of those which were already in the hands of the Government Printer, were destroyed. But considering the means at the disposal of the Compiler, and the pains that have been taken to make the returns as perfect as possible, I feel certain, not withstanding the loss alluded to, that the results show a very marked improvement upon former returns on the same subject.
					<span class="annotation"> [Occupation at different periods of age.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>The population has been divided into fourteen classes—one more than in 1871, the addition being the number of persons out of employment. In previous Census years the number of the unemployed was not given, so that it would appear according to the returns that every individual of the community was engaged in some occupation or other. Of course this could not be correct, and it was therefore considered imperative at the last Census to show how many persons there were who were not earning a livelihood by legitimate means.
					<span class="annotation"> [Classification of population.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Each class is distinguished by the character of its occupations, and is further divided into sub-classes, and the sub-classes again into sections, embracing the most important branches coming under each class.</p>
			<p>The following is a brief summary of the results obtained in each of the principal classes :—</p>
			<p>Class I, " Learned and Educated Professions, " includes sub-class 1, " The Clergy, " sub-class 2, " The Law, " sub-class 3, " The Medical Profession, " and sub-class 4, " Other Educated Professions. " The whole class numbers 10,184 persons, 6,571 males and 3,613 females, and comprises 1.36 per cent. of the total population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Learned and educated.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Sub-class 1, " Clergy, " numbered 725 males ; sub-class 2, " The Law, " numbered 920 males ; sub-class 3, " Medical, " numbered 1,049 males; and sub-class 4, including literature, fine arts, sciences, &amp;c., numbered 3,877 males and 3,613 females.</p>
			<p>Class II, " Government Service, " has three sub-classes. Sub-class 1, " Civil Officers and Subordinates " ; sub-class 2, " Police " ; and sub-class 3, " Permanent Military Force. " In the first sub-class there are 3,962 males and 266 females ; in the second, 1,258 males; and in the third, 301 males, making a total of 5,787 persons, 5,521 males and 266 females, or about 0.77 per cent. of the population.

			<p>As in 1871, by including in this class all persons employed by the Government, whether lawyers, surveyors, engineers, or skilled workers, the numbers of the corresponding classes in which they would otherwise have been classified are correspondingly weakened; but this classification has the advantage of showing the strength of the whole Public Service.</p>
			<p>Class III, " Commercial, " embraces the whole of that part of the population engaged in commercial and trading pursuits. Sub-class 1 comprises bankers and merchants, and persons engaged in the higher branches of commerce. Sub-class 2 includes general dealers, shop- and store-keepers; and sub-class 3 embraces all hired assistants, clerks, shopmen, shopwomen, &amp;c. of the first sub-class there are 4,391 males, of the second there are 6,508 males and 2,267 females, and of the third sub-class there are 8,722 males and 1,013 females, making a total of 22,901 persons—19,621 males and 3,280 females, or 3.05 per cent. of the total population.

			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxxviii"></div>
			<p>Class IV, " Personal Offices. " Under this head are included all persons engaged in producing and distributing refreshment in the shape of food, drink, and accommodation. The numbers are 12,882 males and 1,638 females ; in all 14,520 persons, or about 1.93 per cent. of the total population.

			<p>Class V " Domestic. " This class is by far the largest of the series, and includes all persons engaged in household duties, infants and children not attending school and not otherwise employed, domestic servants, as well as persons of independent means. It also includes children under tution, whether at school or at their own homes. There are three sub-classes, the first of which is divided into four sections : No.1, persons engaged in domestic duties ; No. 2, hired domestic servants ; No. 3. infants and children not attending school; and No. 4, nurses, midwives, &amp;c. In 1871 hired domestic servants were not included in this class, but were placed amongst the unskilled labour class. Sub-class 2 is comprised of persons of independent means, and sub-class 3 embraces children under tuition at home or at school. Taking sub-class 1, section 1, we have 1,316 males and 149,265 females engaged in domestic duties, making a total of 150,581 persons, or 20.03 per cent. of the total population; of section 2, hired domestic servants, there were 33,238 persons, 9,476 males and 23,762 females, or about 4.42 per cent. of the population; of section 3, infants and children not attending school, there were 62,237 males and 61,291 females, numbering 123,528 persons, or 16.43 per cent. of the population ; section 4, " Nurses, &amp;c., " numbers 675 females, or about 0.09 per cent. Sub-class 1 therefore, represents an aggregate of 308,022 persons, 73,029 males and 234,993 females, or 40.97 per cent. of the total population. In sub-class 2, " Persons of Independent Means, " there were 3,044 males and 2,250 females, making 5,294 persons, or about 0.70 per cent. of the population. Of sub-class 3, " Children under Tuition, " there were of section 1, scholars at home 19,792 persons, 8,910 males and 10,882 females, or 2.63 per cent. Of section 2, " Children at School, " there were 135,093, 68,911 males and 66,182 females, or 17.98 per cent, of the population. The total number of persons in this class was therefore 468,201, namely, 153,894 males and 314,307 females, comprising 62.30 per cent. of the total population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Domestic.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Class VI, " Land, " includes all persons engaged in pastoral, agricultural, or horticultural pursuits.
					<span class="annotation"> [Land.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>In this class there are five sub-classes, and each sub-class is divided into three or more sections.</p>
			<p>The first sub-class, " Agricultural, " includes all persons engaged in farming pursuits, namely, section 1, freehold proprietors ; section 2, leasehold proprietors and tenant farmers ; section 3, persons assisting, not being hired servants; and section 4, hired farm servants. The return shows of section 1, 5,795 persons, 5,549 males and 246 females, or 0.77 per cent. of the population ; of section 2, 21,893 persons, 21,312 males and 581 females, or 2.91 per cent.; of section 3, 17,330 persons, 16,746 males and 584 females, or 2.31 per cent.; and of section 4, 9,468 persons, 9,394 males and 74 females, or 1.26 per cent. of the population. The first sub-class, " Agriculture, " therefore, numbers 54,486 persons, namely, 53,001 males and 1,485 females, and represents 7.25 per cent. of the total population.</p>
			<p>The second sub-class, " Pastoral, " is divided into two parts, namely, " Sheep " and " Cattle and Horses, " and each part is subdivided into four sections. In " Sheep, " section 1 includes freeholders ; section 2, leaseholders ; section 3, persons assisting, not being hired servants ; and section 4, boundary-riders, shepherds, hutkeepers, &amp;c. Of the first section there were 581 persons, 553 males and 28 females, or 0.08 per cent. ; of section 2, 2,598 persons, 2,494 males and 104 females, or 0.35 per cent. ; of section 3, 2,596 persons, 2,572 males and 24 females, or 0.35 per cent. ; and of section 4, 8,781 persons, 8,623 males and 158 females, or 1.17 per cent. The total number of persons therefore engaged in sheep-farming was 14,556, comprising 14,242 males and 314 females, or 1.94 per cent. of the total population. In " cattle and horses " there were ninety-five persons freeholders, eighty-nine males and six females ; of leaseholders there were 313 persons, 304 males and nine females ; of persons not being hired servants there were 264 persons, 261 males and three females; of stockmen, hired servants, &amp;c., there were 1,882 persons, 1,829 males and fifty-three females, making a total of this division of pastoral occupations of 2,554 persons, 2,483 males and seventy-one females, or 0.34 per cent. of the population. The total number of persons therefore engaged in pastoral pursuits was 17,110, namely, 16,725 males and 385 females, or 2.28 per cent. of the total population.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xxxix"></div>
			<p>The third sub-class, " Horticultural, " includes gardeners, florists, nurserymen, &amp;c., and is divided into three sections, namely, 1, freeholders ; 2, leaseholders and tenants ; and 3, hired labourers, gardeners, &amp;c. Of section 1, there were 165 persons, 162 males and three females; of section 2, there were 1,780 persons, 1,764 males and sixteen females; and of section three, there were 2,875 persons, 2,872 males and three females, making a total in this sub-class of 4,820 persons, 4,798 males and twenty-two females, or 0.68 per cent. of the total population.</p>
			<p>The fourth sub-class, " Wine-growing, " includes eleven freeholders, nine males and 2 females; 111 leaseholders and tenants, 108 males and three females, and 134 vine-dressers, &amp;c., 130 males and four females, making a total in this sub-class of 256 persons, 247 males and nine females, or 0.03 per cent. of the total population.</p>
			<p>The fifth and last sub-class includes all persons engaged in sugar-growing. There were thirteen freeholders, males, forty leaseholders, also males, and sixty-seven persons engaged as hired labourers, &amp;c. on the sugar plantations, namely, sixty-three males and four females, making a total in this sub-class of 120 persons, 116 males and four females, or about 0.02 per cent. of the population.</p>
			<p>The total number of persons therefore in this class " Land " was 76,792, namely, 74,887 males and 1,905 females, and comprises 10.22 per cent. of the total population.</p>
			<p>Class VII, " Mining. " Of this class 10,723 males, or 1.43 per cent. of the population, were engaged in gold-mining ; 3,463, or 0.46 per cent., were mining for copper, tin, and the inferior metals; and 3,523, or 0.47 per cent., were coal-miners. The total number, therefore, engaged in mining pursuits was 17,709 persons, all males, or 2.36 per cent. of the population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Mining.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Class VIII, " Skilled Workers and Artificers. " This class is divided into six sub-classes, and each sub-class into two sections, " Masters " and " Workmen and Apprentices. " Sub-class 1 includes all persons engaged in the superior arts, watchmakers, jewelers, opticians, musical instrument makers, lithographers, photographers, printers, &amp;c.; sub-class 2, workers in metals, blacksmiths, whitesmiths, &amp;c. ; sub-class 3, workers in wood, boat-builders, cabinet-makers, carpenters, joiners, shipwrights, wheelwrights, &amp;c.; sub-class 4, " Workers in Stone and Earth ": builders, bricklayers, brickmakers, masons, plasterers, potters, &amp;c.; sub-class 5, " Workers in Leather and Skins " : bootmakers, curriers, saddle and harness makers, tanners, &amp;c., and sub-class 6—bookbinders, shirtmakers, tailors, hairdressers, dressmakers, milliners, needlewomen, upholsterers, &amp;c.
					<span class="annotation"> [Skilled workers.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Of the first sub-class all are males, and comprise 400 masters and 2,187 hired workmen and apprentices. Total, 2,587, or 0.34 per cent. of the population.</p>
			<p>Of the second sub-class, also, all are males; 1,284 masters, and 8,054 hired workmen, &amp;c. Total, 9,338, or 1.24 per cent. of the population.</p>
			<p>Of the third sub-class there are 1,260 masters, and 9,496 hired workmen and apprentices. Total, 10,755, or 1.43 per cent. of the population.</p>
			<p>Of the fourth sub-class there are 1,500 masters or employers, and 6,275 hired workmen, &amp;c. Total 7,775, or 1.04 per cent. of the population.</p>
			<p>Of the fifth sub-class there are 1,112 masters, and 4,983 hired workmen, &amp;c. Total, 6,095, or 0.81 per cent. of the population.</p>
			<p>Of the sixth sub-class there are 1,267 male employers and 12,763 persons, 5,133 males and 7,630 females, hired workmen and workwomen, making a total of 14,030 persons, or 1.86 per cent. of the total population.</p>
			<p>The number of persons therefore belonging to the skilled workers and artificers class is 50,580, namely, 42,950 males and 7,630 females, or 6.73 per cent. of the total population.</p>
			<p>Class IX, " Unskilled labour, " all males, comprises well-sinkers, labourers, stone-breakers, scavengers, &amp;c., and numbers 38,994 persons, or about 5,19 per cent. of the total population.
					<span class="annotation"> [Unskilled labour.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Class X, " Seafaring, " all males, is divided into four sub-classes:—1. Masters, officers, pilots, &amp;c.; 2. Seamen of H.M. Navy ; 3. Seamen, &amp;c., mercantile marine; and 4, ballastmen, divers, lightermen, &amp;c. Of the first there are 837 ; second, 1,009; third, 3,441 ; and fourth, 214 ; making a total of 5,501, or 0.73 per cent. of the total population.

			<p>Class XI, " Persons in Asylums, Gaols, &amp;c., " includes all persons receiving public support gratuitously. Of this class there are 4,926 persons, namely, 4,036 males and 890 females, or 0.65 per cent. of the whole population.</p>
			<p>Class XII, " Miscellaneous Occupations, " take in persons engaged in such avocations as do not properly belong to any other class, such as cabmen, Carmen, draymen, &amp;c. (not being hired servants), actors, street musicians, &amp;c. There are in this class 17,610 males and 2,170 females, making 19,780 persons, or 2.63 per cent. of the total population.</p>
			<p>Class XIII, " Occupations not stated, " includes that part of the population whose occupations were omitted to be stated in the householders' schedules, and numbers 2,934 males and 2,846 females—5,780 persons, or 0.76 per cent. of the population.</p>
			<p>Class XIV, " Unemployed, " is made up of those who were absolutely out of employment when the Census was taken. Of these there were 340 domestic servants (25 males and 315 females), or 0.05 per cent. of the population, and 9,473 artisans, miners, seamen, labourers, needlewomen, vagrants, &amp;c., namely, 8,014 males and 1,774 females, or 1.25 per cent. ; making a total of this class of 9,813 persons, or 1.30 per cent. of the population.</p>

			<p>The classification adopted in 1881 is substantially the same as that of 1871, but the arrangement of the details would have been of a much more comprehensive character had not the fire at the Garden Palace destroyed the result of the Compiler's labours in this direction. A very fair comparison of the two periods however is made, which was not possible in 1871 in consequence of the alteration in the mode of classification from that adopted in 1861.
					<span class="annotation"> [Comparison with Census of 1871.] </span>
				</p>
			<p>Table 55 shows the progress of the various occupations during the last decennial period.</p>
			<p>The clergy increased by 220 persons or 43.56 per cent. of their number. In 1871 they had increased by 54.43 per cent. during the previous ten years, so that the rate of increase in the last decade has been 10.87 per cent. less than in the former decennial period.</p>
			<p>The legal and judicial body increased by 331 persons, or 56.03 per cent. of their number; the increase in 1871 was 36.34 per cent., so that the number of persons engaged in " the law " had increased at the rate of 19.69 per cent. more than in the previous decade.</p>
			<p>The medical profession showed a very large advance on the previous decade, the addition being 405, or 62.88 per cent. of their number, as against 21.60 per cent. in 1871, making a difference in favour of the last decennial period of no less than 41.28 per cent.</p>
			<p>In literature, science, and arts, the progress has been very marked, the addition being 3,367 persons, or 81.64 per cent. ; namely, 1,664 males, or 75.42 per cent., and 1,703 females, or 89.16 per cent. of their numbers. The increase in the decade ending 1871 was large, being 59.56 per cent., but the rate in the last decennial period was greater than the former by no less than 22.08 per cent.</p>
			<p>To the Government Service there is an addition of 2,014 persons, or 58.00 per cent. of their number, namely, 1,913 males, or 57.79 per cent., and 101 females, or 61.21 per cent. In 1871 the increase was 52.01 per cent., so that the Government Service was augmented at the rate of 5.99 per cent. greater than during the previous decade.</p>
			<p>In addition to the above, there are 301 males belonging to the Permanent Military Force, which did not exist in 1871.</p>
			<p>Trade and Commerce have made rapid strides during the period 1871-81, the addition being 11,363 persons, or 98.48 per cent. of their number. The males had increased by 9,343, or 90.89 per cent., and the females by 2,020, or 160.32 per cent. The increase during the previous decennial period was comparatively small, being only 36.38 per cent., so that the rate of increase was 62.10 per cent. greater in the last decade than in the former.</p>
			<p>Production and distribution of food and drink, &amp;c.—The increase of persons engaged in this class was 6,040, or 71.23 per cent. of their number, namely, 5,355 males, or 71.13 per cent., and 685 females, or 71.88 per cent. In 1871 the increase was only 15.34 per cent., so that the rate at which this class of persons had increased was 55.89 per cent. greater in 1881 than in 1871.</p>
			<p>Land.—In collecting the Census amongst the agriculturists an attempt was made to distinguish between absolute freeholders of the land they tilled and tenant farmers; but the result was by no means satisfactory, inasmuch as there appeared to be a general disinclination on the part of conditional purchasers to state whether the balance of their purchase money had been paid or not. In all instances in which it was ascertained that such was the case they were included amongst " freeholders " ; but in all other cases they were classed amongst " tenant farmers. " This classification, therefore, was in some respects a failure, as conditional purchasers have generally been considered as freeholders, whether the balance of their purchase money had been paid or not. In comparing the results of the Census of 1881 with those of the previous Census, the total number of farmers can consequently only be dealt with. The increase of farm proprietors and tenants during the decade was 6,498 males, or 31.91 per cent. of their number, and 196 females, or 31.06 per cent., making a total increase of 6,694 persons, or 32.56 per cent. of their numbers. Of persons employed on farms, not being hired servants, there was an increase of 3,269 males, or 24.25 per cent., and 96 females, or 19.67 per cent., total, 3,365 persons, or 24.10 per cent. of their number. Of hired farm servants</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xlii"></div>
			<p>The increase was 765 males, or 8.86 per cent.; but there was a decrease of 143 in the females, which made a total increase of 622 persons, or 7.03 per cent. of their number. In carefully considering the above figures, we are brought to the conclusion that the addition to the farming class is principally amongst those of small holdings, and that the tillage of the land is mainly carried on by the owner himself and the members of his family, as the increase of the labouring class of farming men is in no way commensurate with the increase of proprietors. The total increase of persons of all classes—employers and employed—engaged in agricultural pursuits in the decade was 10,681, or 24.38 per cent. of their number, as against an increase in the previous decennial period of 6,437 persons, or 17.23 per cent., thus showing an addition in favour of the last decade of 7.15 per cent. as compared with the previous one.</p>
			<p>Pastoral.—The increase in the number of sheep-farmers has been very large, and may in a great measure be accounted for by the fact that many conditional purchasers have turned their attention to sheep-farming in preference to agriculture. The increase is 1,805 males, or 145.33 per cent., and 71 females, or 116.39 per cent., making a total of 1,876 persons, or 143.97 per cent. of their number. Of persons engaged in this pursuit, not being hired servants, there is an increase of 1,121 males, or 77.25 per cent., and 4 females, or 20.00 per cent., making a total of 1,125 persons, or 76.48 per cent. of their number. Of boundary riders, shepherds, hut-keepers, &amp;c., the numbers have considerably fallen off, there being an actual decrease of 1,582 males, or 15.50 per cent., and of 365 females, or 69.60 per cent., making a total decrease of 1,947 persons, or 18.15 per cent. of their number. This falling off is accounted for by the fact that considerable improvements have been made in pastoral properties in the shape of fencing, &amp;c., which has rendered the employment of shepherds unnecessary to a very large extent as compared with former years, and this fencing has been erected principally on freehold properties, which have accumulated largely during the last decade. It is attributable also to the fact that in the case of small holders the duties of the shepherds, &amp;c., are performed by members of the family.</p>
			<p>Of stockholders in horses and cattle the number has diminished by 234 persons, or 36.45 per cent. of their number, namely, males by 195, or 33.16 per cent., and females by 39, or 72.22 per cent. This falling off, however, is more apparent than real, inasmuch as many of those who in 1871 were principally engaged in the breeding of cattle and horses have, during the decade, turned their attention to sheep-farming, which has become the more important occupation of the two, and they have been returned among the " sheep-farmers " without having relinquished their interest in raising cattle. The result, however, points to the fact that wool-growing is more profitable than cattle-breeding. Of persons engaged with stockholders, not being hired servants there is also a proportionate decrease of 115 males and 4 females; 119 persons, or 31.07 per cent. of their number. Hired stockmen and servants have also fallen off by 1,426 persons, or 43.11 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>There was therefore a falling off in the number of persons engaged in grazing—masters and servants—of 725, or 4.06 per cent., as against an increase in the previous decennial period of 3,328 persons, or 22.94 per cent.</p>
			<p>Horticultural.—The increase to the number of gardeners, nurserymen, florists, and persons engaged in horticulture, has been very great during the decade, the addition to the number of persons so engaged in 1871 being 1,062, or no less than 120.56 per cent. Of males the increase was 1,056, or 121.38 per cent., and of females 6, or 46.15 per cent. of their numbers. Of persons hired as assistants in this industry there was an increase of 774, or 36.84 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>In wine-growing, also, the progress has been marked, the number of persons owning vineyards having increased by 48 or 64.86 per cent.</p>
			<p>In sugar-growing the increase has been by 23 owners of sugar plantations, or 76.66 per cent. of their number, while of hired persons engaged in the cultivation of the cane there was an increase of 38 persons, or 131.03 per cent.</p>
			<p>The total increase, therefore, of persons employed in the various industries connected with the land is 11,863, or 18.28 per cent. of their number; the males increased by 11,985, or 19.05 per cent., and the females decreased by 122, or 6.40 per cent.</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xliii"></div>
			<p>Mining.—There has been a great falling off in the number of gold-miners during the decade, the decrease being 5,538, or about 34.06 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>Miners in the inferior metals, copper, tin, &amp;c., have, however, largely increased, the addition being 3,345 persons, or no less than 2,834.75 per cent. of their number. Coal-mining has also progressed in a marked manner, the increase in the number of miners being 1,373, or 63.86 per cent.</p>
			<p>There is, therefore, a decrease in the total number of miners of all kinds of 820, or 4.63 per cent. of their number, while the decrease in the previous decade was by 2,853 persons, or 13.34 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>Skilled Workers.—The increase in the number of skilled workers in the various branches has been very marked during the decade. This fact is a striking proof of the progress of manufacture under the free-trade policy of the Colony.</p>
			<p>In the superior arts, including watchmakers, jewelers, lithographers, opticians, photographers, printers, &amp;c., the increase has been 94 employers, or 30.72 per cent., and 1,274 hired workmen and apprentices, or 139.54 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>Workers in Metals.—Blacksmiths, coppersmiths, cutlers, farriers, locksmiths, shipsmiths, &amp;c., have increased by 465 employers, or 56.77 per cent., and by 4,529 hired workmen and apprentices, or 132.23 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>Workers in Wood, including boatbuilders, cabinetmakers, carpenters, coopers, joiners, wheelwrights, &amp;c., have increased by 243 employers, or 23.89 per cent., and 4,245 hired workmen and apprentices, or 80.87 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>Workers in Leather and Skins, including bootmakers, curriers, harnessmakers, saddlers, tanners, &amp;c., have only increased by 30 employers, or 2.77 per cent., and by 877 hired workmen and apprentices, or 21.36 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>Miscellaneous, which includes both males and females, and consists of barbers, hairdressers, shirtmakers, tailors, upholsterers, bookbinders, dressmakers, milliners, &amp;c., have increased by 588 employers, or 86.60 per cent. of their number, and by 2,320 hired workmen and apprentices, or 82.47 per cent. The females had increased by 2,395, or 56.55 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>Thus it will be seen that the total increase of skilled workers of all classes was, during the decade, 18,939 persons, or 78.88 per cent. of their number, being nearly 30.00 per cent. greater than the rate of increase of the total population.</p>
			<p>Unskilled Labour.—Under this head in 1871 hired domestic servants were included, but in the present classification, as has already been pointed out, domestic servants have been classed under the head " domestic. " The remainder consists of well-sinkers, labourers, stone-breakers, scavengers, &amp;c., and they have increased by 19,964 persons, or 104.91 per cent. of their number.</p>
			<p>Seafaring.—Sub-class 1, including masters, officers, pilots, &amp;c., increased by 149 or 21.66 per cent. Sub-classes 2 and 3, which includes seamen of H.M. Navy and the Mercantile Marine, but which were not separately distinguished in 1871, increased by 860 or 23.96 per cent. of their number, while sub-class 4, ballastmen, lightermen, lumpers, stevedores, &amp;c., decreased by 28 or 13.08 per cent. This apparent falling off may be accounted for by the fact that mere labourers engaged in loading and unloading ships were included amongst the seafaring in 1871, but who are classed amongst the " unskilled " in the present returns. The same reason accounts for the very large increase in unskilled labour as compared with 1871.</p>
			<p>The number of persons receiving public support gratuitously, including paupers, lunatics, convicted prisoners, persons awaiting trial, and individuals living in Benevolent Asylums, have increased in the males by 838 or 26.20 per cent., but have decreased in the females by 185 or 17.21 per cent. The general increase, including both sexes, is only 653 or 15.28 per cent. of their number. This is a most satisfactory state of things, and speaks highly for the general prosperity of the Colony, the rate of increase of this class being 33.72 per cent. less than that of the total population of the Colony.</p>
			<p>Of persons engaged in miscellaneous occupations not otherwise classified there is an increase of 8,505 or 75.43 per cent. The males increased by 8,972 or 102.71 per cent., and the females decreased by 467 or 17.71 per cent. of their number. By table No. 55 it would appear that the general increase in this class of persons was</p>
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-02_xliv"></div>
			<p>Only 27.53 per cent.; but according to a note attached to Table No. 46 in the Census returns of 1871, milliners, dressmakers, &amp;c., were included amongst " Miscellaneous Occupations not otherwise classified, " for the sake of comparison with the previous Census of 1861, when all needlewomen were so classed. Such classification was obviously wrong, and therefore needlewomen, dressmakers, milliners, &amp;c., are now returned as " skilled workers, " and the calculations in this Report are based upon the corrected figures.</p>
			<p>Of persons whose occupations were not given in the householders' schedules there is a very small increase over the like omissions in 1871, namely, 166 or about 2.96 per cent. There was a large decrease in the number of males in this category, but a larger increase in the number of females whose occupations were not stated. The decrease in the former amounted to 1,477 or 50.34 per cent., and the increase in the females to 1,643 or 136.57 per cent. This increase is accounted for by the fact that in 1871, in nearly all cases of females whose occupations were not stated, they were classified as being engaged in " domestic duties " ; but at the last Census this plan was not adopted unless there was sufficient evidence in the schedule to justify the assumption that such was their avocation.</p>
			<p>In 1871 there was no return of the unemployed, so that no comparison can be made between the two periods in this respect.</p>
			<p>As a conclusion to this Report, I have to thank Mr. F.C. Logan and the other portion of the staff employed in tabulating the returns of this Census—which were all unfortunately destroyed in the fire at the Garden Palace—for the efficient manner in which they performed that portion of the work. In Mr. John Byron, the Compiler, I have found a gentleman in every way qualified for the duty entrusted to him. A perusal of this Report, which is entirely his production, will, I feel sure, satisfy the Government that he possesses ability of no mean order in dealing with statistical returns.</p>
			<p>I have the honor to be,</p>
			<p>Sir,</p>
			<p>Your obedient servant,</p>
			<p>EDWARD GRANT WARD.</p>

				<h3 class="paragraph-title">B.</h3>
				<p>HOUSEHOLDER'S SCHEDULE.—GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
			
			<p>This Schedule is to be filled up by the occupier or person in charge of the dwelling.—If let or sub-let to different persons or families, in separate stories or apartments, each such story or apartment must be treated as a separate dwelling, and the occupier or person in charge of each must make a separate Return upon a separate form.</p>
			<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING UP THE COLUMN HEADED "RANK, PROFESSION, OR OCCUPATION."</p>
			<p>Officers in the Army and Navy to add, after their rank, whether in actual service, or half-pay, or retired; and in the latter case, if engaged in any occupation, to be particular in stating it.</p>
			<p>Persons in the Civil Service to state, after their title or rank, the Department to which they are attached, and also whether they are engaged in any other and what besides their official occupation.</p>
			<p>Clergymen to state the Denomination of which they are ministers, and the place of worship in which they officiate. They are requested not to employ the indefinite term "Clerk." Local or occasional preachers to return their ordinary occupations.</p>
			<p>Members of the legal profession to state whether or not in actual practice; and if holding any office, to give its title. Lawyers admitted elsewhere, but not on the rolls here, to state the grade and country. Persons employed by barristers or in solicitors' offices, to distinguish whether they are articled or other clerks.</p>
			<p>Members of the Medical Profession to state whether they are physicians, surgeons, or general practitioners, and to return themselves as practicing or not practicing ; and if otherwise employed, to state the occupation.</p>
			<p>Teachers, authors, public writers, and artists to state the particular branch of science, literature, or art which they cultivate. Engineers to state whether civil engineer, mechanical engineer, mining engineer, &amp;c. Surveyors to state whether land, mining, or marine surveyors.</p>
			<p>Persons engaged in trade or commerce, as merchants, manufacturers, storekeepers, retailers, brokers, agents, auctioneers, clerks, &amp;c., to state the particular business in which they are engaged, or the staple in which they deal. The ordinary and most commonly understood terms should be employed. Commercial travelers should not omit the word "commercial."</p>
			<p>The terms farmer and gardener to be applied to all persons actually in occupation of land and tilling, whether proprietors or tenants. The number of hands employed should be returned thus— "Farmer or gardener employing—men." The word landowner is too vague. Proprietorship may be expressed by inserting ("prop.") after "farmer." Sons and daughters, brothers, or other relatives helping on farms or stations, may be returned as "son assisting," "daughter assisting," as the case may be.</p>
			<p>Gold-miners to specify whether engaged in puddling, sluicing, quartz-mining, crushing, &amp;c., or alluvial mining. When a gold-miner employs others to assist him, he should return himself "gold-miner, employing —men." A gold-miner working for another should return himself as "gold-miner," not as a labourer.</p>
			<p>Artizans and mechanics should always mention whether they are masters or journeymen, whether they keep a shop, store, &amp;c., and the number of persons in their employment. The materials on which mechanics work, and the particular branch of their trade, are always to be distinctly expressed; thus— "ship carpenter," "house carpenter," "shingler," "coachsmith," "locksmith," "horse-shoer."</p>
			<p>A person engaged in more than one pursuit should state his occupations in the order of their importance to himself.</p>
			<p>Carters, carriers, labourers, servants, &amp;c., to describe themselves by the name of their usual employment ; "drayman on wharf," "carter to the diggings," "labourer, making roads," "omnibus-driver," "cabman," "porter," "messenger," &amp;c.</p>
			<p>Persons not following any profession, trade, or calling, and not holding any public office, but possessed of independent means, may designate themselves "proprietor of land," "proprietor of houses," "annuitant," as the case may be. The word "householder" should not be used in place of "proprietor of houses," nor the word "gentleman" or "lady" in place of "no occupation." Persons who have ceased to follow one pursuit and have not commenced another, should enter "no occupation at present." Persons out of work should enter "unemployed" after their ordinary calling.</p>
			<p>WOMEN.—The occupation of women not coming under the foregoing instructions, and who are employed in any but domestic duties, should be distinctly recorded. But they should not be entered as engaged in the occupations of their husbands or fathers, &amp;c., unless they regularly assist them. When only in the capacity of wife, mother, daughter, sister, &amp;c., write "domestic duties."</p>
			<p>CHILDREN.—If children are regularly pursuing or assisting in any occupation it should be stated. If daily attending a Public or Private School, or receiving tuition under a master or governess at home, it should be specified by writing against the names "attending Public School," "attending Private School," "scholar at home," as the case may be. When too young to attend school, write "infant."</p>
			<p>PERSONS IN HOSPITALS, ASYLUMS, GAOLS, &amp;c.—Care should be taken to describe their position as inmates, thus:— "prisoner," "patient," "gaoler," "nurse." Previous occupation of prisoners, patients, &amp;c., should be inserted, as well as their present occupation in the hospitals, asylums, gaols, &amp;c.</p>
			<p>The occupation which each person is following and deriving income from at the time of the Census should in all cases be stated.</p>
			<p>Every answer should be written in full. The use of dots (,,) or ditto (do.) leads to numerous mistakes, and cannot be admitted by the Collectors.</p>

			<p>(Circular No. 3.)</p>
			<p>Census Office,</p>
			<p>Sydney, 15 January, 1881.</p>
			<p>Sir,</p>
			<p>With reference to my former Circular, under date of I have now the honor to inform you that you have been appointed enumerator of the Census to be taken on the 3rd April, 1881, for the district of</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>A circular will be prepared, minutely defining your duties, and laying down such special instructions as may be deemed necessary to guide you and the collectors in carrying out the provisions of the Act.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>In the meantime I enclose revised description of the boundaries of your district, as proclaimed in the Government Gazette of. They have been so altered as to agree with the boundaries of the Electoral Districts, so that in no case do they now overlap one another. You will see that the subdivisions occasioned by the intersection and non-coincidence of Police and Electoral Districts, of Towns and Villages throughout the Colony, of Parishes in Cumberland, and of Wards in Municipalities, are carefully regarded.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>I also enclose tracings of your district, with a list of the subdivisions absolutely necessary. The duplicate tracing you will please return, with Schedule C, after having marked on it any further subdivisions that you may think convenient for collection.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>You will be good enough to fill in the information required in the accompanying Schedule C, showing the number of collectors it will be necessary for you to employ, whether on foot or on horseback, and the number of days they are likely to be employed. You will also give the computed number of habitations in each sub-district, the computed extent of each sub-district, and the estimated number of householders' Schedules each collector will require. The duty of the collectors should be performed within the shortest possible period, and, except in extreme cases—the circumstances connected with which must be specially reported—within the week preceding and that succeeding the 3rd of April.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
				<p>The rates at which collectors are to be paid have been fixed at ten shillings per diem for persons employed on foot, and at not more than twenty shillings per diem for those on horseback. No higher rates will be allowed, except under very special circumstances, to be reported to the Registrar-General for his decision. The collectors will, of course, be paid only for the days during which they are actually employed.</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-03_lxxxi"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>Your special attention is drawn to the following copy of clause 16 of the Census Act for 1881:— "Any person accepting the office of enumerator or collector under this Act and afterwards refusing or neglecting to do anything lawfully required of him in virtue of such office unless prevented by sickness or other unavoidable cause (in which case the Governor with the advice aforesaid may forthwith appoint another enumerator or the enumerator may appoint another collector approved as aforesaid) shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds."</p>

				<p>Further Instructions issued to Enumerators.</p>
			
			<p>(Circular No. 4.)</p>
			<p>Census Office, Sydney, 24 February, 1881.</p>
			<p>Sir,</p>
			<p>With reference to Circular No. 3, accompanying maps and descriptions of your district, I will endeavour to point out as clearly as possible what will be your duties and those of the collectors under you. If, however, any of these instructions should not be quite understood, you will not hesitate to communicate with me, when I shall be happy to give you any further explanation that you may require.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>I have to draw your attention to the "Census Act for 1881." 44 Victoria No. 2—copy of which is sent herewith. Clause 16, which has already been pointed out to you, will be strictly adhered to. The names of the collectors appointed agreeably to the 4th section will be submitted for approval of the Governor as early as possible. Should you be deprived of the services of either one of the collectors after acceptance of office within too short a time before the taking of the Census to enable you to engage a fit person in his place, you will either act yourself, or devolve the duty on one or more of the other Collectors ; and you will report the circumstances of the case to me, for the information of the Government.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>It is not deemed advisable to issue from this office separate instructions for the use of the collectors, but it is expected that you will extract from this Circular such instructions as may be necessary for their information, supplementing them as you may think fit, and giving them at the same time a copy of those clauses in the Census Act which have more direct reference to them.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>If you see any chance of a misunderstanding between any of your collectors and those of the surrounding districts, you should communicate with the enumerator of such district, in order to avoid confusion.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>Presuming that you have now so divided your district that the number of collectors selected will be able to perform the work as nearly as possible within the prescribed time, it will be necessary for them to commence the distribution of the Schedules on or before the 28th March, taking the remote and rural parts first, so that if it should be necessary for you to apply to me for a further supply of Schedules these may be used for the villages or more densely peopled places where the least time is required for distributing them.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
				<p>It is provided that in remote districts the heads of establishments shall include in their returns the names of all persons employed on or about their respective establishments ; but in all such cases, and also in towns, great vigilance must be exercised by the collectors, otherwise the heads of such establishments may from mis-apprehension include the names of persons employed by them during the day, who will again be returned in respect of the premises where they will sleep or reside on the night of Sunday, the 3rd April. The proper course to follow in every case is to return those persons only who slept or abode on the premises during the night between the 3rd and 4th April.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>With regard to large pastoral establishments, you will give particular instructions to your collectors to obtain a correct return of the number and description of occupied huts or other dwellings. It should be pointed out to employers or superintendents in charge, that not only should the dwellings on the head station be given, but also all occupied residences on the establishment, wherever situated, and the inmates of each should be distinctly given. For all such one return will be sufficient. If, however, any out station belonging to an establishment with your district is situated in the district of another enumerator, or in another subdivision of your own district, such return will of course be given only by the collector of that district.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
				<p>When the collector calls for the returns be should carefully peruse and examine each paper in order that he may be enabled to see that all the information required by the Act has been inserted by the householder, or, if not, that he may ask any necessary question or supply any deficiency before leaving the house or establishment. The collector should be provided with spare Schedules and supplemental sheets, to substitute for any that may be injured or lost.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
				<p>In the case of persons who cannot write the Schedule may be filled up by any competent person, but it must be signed by the householder by mark, to be witnessed by the collector, who should in such case read aloud to the householder the contents of the Schedule.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
				<p>The attention of the collector must be particularly directed to the endorsement of the householder's schedules, which must be very carefully filled up.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
				<p>To avoid any difficulty in taking the Census of the Chinese population, should there be any in your district, Chinese Interpreters may be engaged if necessary, to accompany the collectors to the camps or settlements of the Chinese, and to assist them in filling up the Schedules. These interpreters will be paid at the same rate as collectors ; but before they are appointed the enumerator should communicate with me, giving all particulars as to their names, the time they are likely to be employed, &amp;c.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
				<p>If the locality in which the Census is taken is a gold-field it should be stated in the endorsement of the Schedule.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
				<p>For large institutions, such as hospitals, asylums, gaols, &amp;c., the householder's schedule and supplemental Sheets are to be used, leaving blank such columns as the managers may be unable to fill up. For the heads of these establishments, however, as well as for any officers or assistants sleeping on the premises the usual information must be supplied.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
				<p>By the 7th section of the Act an account is required of houseless persons and travellers. The collectors should be directed to give their attention in the first place early on the morning of the 3rd April to those places to which travellers and others camping out usually resort, so that an accurate account of them may be obtained before they begin to move. In some districts it may be desirable to employ a special collector for this object. The aborigines, who lead a roving life, are not included under the denomination of houseless persons and travellers ; but you will endeavour to obtain, if not accurate information (which may be impossible), an approximate estimate of the numbers and sexes of the wild tribes in your district. Any civilized blacks employed in a house or establishment will be inserted in the ordinary manner in the householder's schedule. No special schedule has been printed for houseless persons ; the householder's schedule must be used for them, leaving blank those columns having no reference to them.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">15.</h3>
				<p>The Schedules, when duly filled up, must be numbered and delivered to you by each collector on or before the 16th April ; the collector will then be required to make before a Magistrate a solemn declaration of their accuracy, in the form annexed to the Act. The Schedules must then be arranged by you in regular series for each parish, municipality, town, &amp;c., having regard to all the necessary subdivisions. As soon as conveniently may be, after the receipt of the returns from the collectors, you will appoint a day for their examination, requiring at the same time the attendance of the collectors, to afford any information touching the accuracy of the returns ; it will then rest with you to supply or correct, as far as possible, any defect or inaccuracy which you local knowledge may enable you to discover.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
				<p>Your duty, after you have examined these returns, and supplied any deficiency in the information, will be to see that they are accurately arranged according to the several territorial divisions of your district, as already explained, and to transmit the whole to this office, duly numbered in regular series, attaching at the same time the certificate required by the Act (Schedule B), and a collective return in the form enclosed (marked C), which, if properly filled up, will be held to be a sufficient compliance with the requirements of the 10th section of the Act ; the total of such collective return will of course agree with the totals of the several divisions given by you. As a precaution against possible loss of the original returns a duplicate of the latter statement must be sent separately by the next post.</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-03_lxxxii"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">17.</h3>
				<p>With reference to the last column in the householder's schedule, it will be necessary that the collectors should take down the number and description (as far as possible) of all houses untenanted or in course of erection in his sub-district.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
				<p>It is suggested that, for that purpose, as well as for collecting such information regarding Aborigines, &amp;c., as cannot be included in the householder's schedule, the collectors should provide themselves with memorandum books ; the information contained therein to be carefully collated by yourself and forwarded to this office, together with all other papers. They should also have waterproof bags to carry the Schedules in.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
				<p>Collectors will be paid for such Sundays on which they may be actually on the road, and a certificate to this effect should be given by you.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">20.</h3>
				<p>You will see by section 12 of the Act that all public persons are required to give their co-operation and advice in this national work. A circular has been addressed to the several Benches of Magistrates, Municipal Councils, Gold Commissioners, &amp;c., asking their assistance and advice in any case in which you may have to apply to them.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">21.</h3>
				<p>Copies of a public notice which has reference to the Census will be forwarded to you under separate cover, and I have to request that you will, on or before the 15th March, cause the same to be affixed to the several Court-houses, Post Offices, Telegraph Offices, and such other conspicuous places as you may think proper throughout your district.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">22.</h3>
				<p>I forward under separate cover forms of declaration of acceptance of office, to be signed by each collector, after you have inserted, in the space left for that purpose, a full description of that portion of your district allotted to him. These forms are to be returned to me as soon as completed.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">23.</h3>
				<p>Forms of vouchers for payment of the sums due for collection and for any necessary disbursements, by way of postages or otherwise, as well as the householders' schedules and other papers will be forwarded to you shortly.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">24.</h3>
				<p>It is of course well understood that the collection of the agricultural and live stock returns is to be made simultaneously with that of the Census, and that no additional emolument is attached thereto.</p>

				<p>Instructions issued by the Registrar-General as Enumerator for the Sydney Registry District, to the Collectors appointed to take the Census of the said District.</p>
			
			<p>Census Office,</p>
			<p>Sydney, 23rd March, 1881.</p>
			<p>Instructions issued to the Collectors appointed to take the Census of the District of Sydney.</p>
			<p>THE Census of the City of Sydney will be taken by wards, each ward having been divided into a certain number of parts or sub-districts.</p>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">2.</h3>
				<p>Each collector will receive a description of the sub-district allotted to him, but as some of the lanes or alleys may have been left out, it will be the duty of the collector to visit every dwelling in his division.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">3.</h3>
				<p>The collectors will carry with them these instructions, as well as the notification of their appointment, which they will exhibit in case their right to act as collectors should be questioned.</p>
			
			<div class="page-break" id="NSW-1881-census-03_lxxxiii"></div>
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">4.</h3>
				<p>The object being to take a Census of all persons in the Colony on the night of Sunday, the 3rd day of April, 1881, no other names are to be inserted in the schedule but those of the members of the household or family, visitors, servants, and others, either sleeping or abiding in the dwelling on that night.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">5.</h3>
				<p>The word dwelling is intended by the Act to include all buildings and tenements, or other erections, whether permanent or temporary, of which the whole or any part shall be used as a habitation ; therefore outhouses, porters' lodges, &amp;c., are not to be returned as separate dwellings, but as part of the household they respectively belong to.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">6.</h3>
				<p>A household, however, is not intended in every case to include all persons in the same house. Whenever two or more families are living separately, although under the same roof, each family should be taken as a separate household, and receive a separate schedule to fill up. This does not apply to lodgers or visitors, who are looked upon as members of the household. The collector will therefore be very careful when leaving the schedules to ascertain how many families are residing in the house, so that he may leave a separate schedule for each family, if possible, with the head of such family.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">7.</h3>
				<p>He will also inquire whether the household is composed of more than fifteen persons, when one or more supplemental sheets should be left.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">8.</h3>
				<p>When distributing the schedules the collector should give notice that he will call for them on Monday, the 4th of April, or as soon after as practicable, as shown on the endorsement.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">9.</h3>
				<p>The duties of the collector will commence in the course of the last week but one in March, and all the schedules must be delivered before the evening of Saturday, the 2nd of April.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">10.</h3>
				<p>Early on the morning of Monday, the 4th of April, the collection of the schedules will commence ; and in taking them from the hands of the householder, occupier, or person in charge, the greatest care should be exercised by the collector, who will satisfy himself that all the columns have been filled up in accordance with the headings, and any errors are to be there and then corrected, or any omissions supplied under his direction. He will also see, by referring to his memorandum-book, that he receives all the schedules left by him in each house.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">11.</h3>
				<p>In the case of persons who cannot write, the schedule may be filled up by any competent person, or in the absence of any such by the collector himself, but it must be signed by the householder or occupier by mark, to be witnessed by the collector, who will read aloud the contents of the schedule, so as to make sure that the person signing is aware of them. He will also and in all cases sign his name at the foot of every schedule when completed.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">12.</h3>
				<p>The greatest courtesy should be shown by the collector in the execution of his duties, and all explanations required of him should be given with the utmost willingness. If, however, it happens that any householder or occupier of a dwelling should deliberately refuse or willfully neglect to fill up, to the best of his knowledge, any one of the columns of the schedule, the collector will point out to him that, under clause 13 of the Census Act. 44 Vict. No. 2 (a copy of which is hereunder given), he lays himself open by so doing to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">13.</h3>
				<p>Large institutions, such as hospitals, asylums, gaols, &amp;c., are to be returned as one household, and it should be ascertained by the collector how many supplemental sheets are required. It will be left to the head or manager of such establishment to give as much information as he can to the patients, inmates, &amp;c., under his charge. But with regard to himself and family, or to any officer or assistant on the premises during the night of the 3rd April, the usual information should be supplied.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">14.</h3>
				<p>Collectors having in their subdivisions any of the quays, wharves, warehouses, &amp;c., lining the harbour, should bear in mind that they have nothing to do with the shipping, and be careful in the case of seamen, &amp;c., to satisfy themselves that their names have not already been taken down on board the ships, &amp;c., to which they belong. The same in hotels, &amp;c., where the landlord should be cautioned against entering the names of any travellers or others having arrived during the night, unless he is certain that they have not already been taken down before landing, or whilst travelling on the road.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">15.</h3>
				<p>All travellers, lodgers, servants, &amp;c., residing in hotels, or inns, are to be included in the same schedule.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">16.</h3>
				<p>An exact estimate being required of the number of houses in Sydney, whether occupied or not, it will be necessary for the collector to insert in his memorandum-book a description of every uninhabited house in his sub-district.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">17.</h3>
				<p>The schedules when completed are to be numbered by each collector, and delivered each day as may be directed ; and no payment will be made in any case until such schedules have been examined, and it has been ascertained that the duties have been satisfactorily performed.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">18.</h3>
				<p>Agriculture.—An occupier's schedule should be left with all holders of land exceeding 1 acre.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">Livestock.—</h3>
				<p>The collector will insert in the forms furnished him for that purpose the necessary information with regard to any live stock belonging to individual owners.</p>
			
			
				<h3 class="paragraph-title">19.</h3>
				<p>It now only remains to call attention to the different clauses of the Census Act, extracted for the information of the collectors, and more especially to clause 14, having reference to the penalty they render themselves liable to for willful default.</p>
